# And There Shall Be No More Death

A week ago was Easter, and our thoughts were focused again on the atoning
sacrifice and Resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ. This past year I have
been thinking and pondering about the Resurrection more than normal.

Nearly one year ago, our daughter Alisa died. She had struggled with cancer
for almost eight years, with several surgeries, many different treatments,
exciting miracles, and deep disappointments. We watched her physical condition
deteriorate as she came to the close of her mortal life. It was excruciating
to see that happen to our precious daughter--that bright-eyed little baby who
had grown up to be a talented, wonderful woman, wife, and mother. I thought my
heart would break.

Last year at Easter time, a little over a month before she passed away, Alisa
wrote: "Easter is a reminder of all that I hope for myself. That someday I
will be healed and someday I will be whole. Someday I won't have any metal or
plastic inside of me. Someday my heart will be free of fear and my mind free
of anxieties. I am not praying that this happens soon, but I am so glad I
truly believe in a beautiful afterlife."[1]

The Resurrection of Jesus Christ ensures the very things Alisa hoped for and
instills in each of us "a reason [for] the hope that is in [us]."[2] President
Gordon B. Hinckley referred to the Resurrection as "the greatest of all events
in the history of mankind."[3]

The Resurrection is brought to pass by the Atonement of Jesus Christ and is
pivotal to the great plan of salvation.[4] We are spirit children of heavenly
parents.[5] When we come to this earth life, our spirit is united with our
body. We experience all the joys and challenges associated with mortal life.
When a person dies, their spirit is separated from their body. Resurrection
makes it possible for a person's spirit and body to be united again, only this
time that body will be immortal and perfect--not subject to pain, disease, or
other problems.[6]

After resurrection, the spirit will never again be separated from the body
because the Savior's Resurrection brought total victory over death. In order
to obtain our eternal destiny, we need to have this immortal soul--a spirit
and body--united forever. With spirit and immortal body inseparably connected,
we can "receive a fulness of joy."[7] In fact, without the Resurrection we
could never receive a fulness of joy but would be miserable forever.[8] Even
faithful, righteous people view the separation of their bodies from their
spirits as captivity. We are released from this captivity through the
Resurrection, which is redemption from the bands or chains of death.[9] There
is no salvation without both our spirit and our body.

Each of us has physical, mental, and emotional limitations and weaknesses.
These challenges, some of which seem so intractable now, will eventually be
resolved. None of these problems will plague us after we are resurrected.
Alisa researched survival rates for persons with the type of cancer she had,
and the numbers were not encouraging. She wrote: "But there is a cure, so I'm
not scared. Jesus has already cured my cancer, and yours. ... I _will_ be
better. I'm glad I know this."[10]

We can replace the word _cancer_ with any of the other physical, mental, or
emotional ailments we may face. Because of the Resurrection, they have already
been cured too. The miracle of resurrection, the ultimate cure, is beyond the
power of modern medicine. But it is not beyond the power of God. We know it
can be done because the Savior is resurrected and will bring to pass the
Resurrection of each of us too.[11]

The Resurrection of the Savior proves that He is the Son of God and that what
He taught is real. "He is risen, as he said."[12] There could be no stronger
proof of His divinity than Him coming forth from the grave with an immortal
body.

We know of witnesses to the Resurrection in New Testament times. In addition
to the women and men we read about in the Gospels, the New Testament assures
us that hundreds actually saw the resurrected Lord.[13] And the Book of Mormon
tells of many hundreds more: "The multitude went forth, and thrust their hands
into his side, ... and [they] did see with their eyes and did feel with their
hands, and did know of a surety and did bear record, that it was he, of whom
it was written by the prophets, that should come."[14]

To those ancient witnesses are added witnesses in the latter days. In fact, in
the opening scene of this dispensation, Joseph Smith saw the resurrected
Savior with the Father.[15] Living prophets and apostles have testified of the
reality of the resurrected, living Christ.[16] So we may say, "We also are
compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses."[17] And each of us can be
part of a cloud of witnesses who know through the power of the Holy Ghost that
what we celebrate on Easter actually happened--that the Resurrection is real.

The reality of the Resurrection of the Savior overwhelms our heartbreak with
hope because with it comes the assurance that all the other promises of the
gospel are just as real--promises that are no less miraculous than the
Resurrection. We know that He has the power to cleanse us from all our sins.
We know that He has taken upon Himself all our infirmities, pains, and the
injustices we have suffered.[18] We know that He has "rise[n] from the dead,
with healing in his wings."[19] We know that He can make us whole no matter
what is broken in us. We know that He "shall wipe away all tears from [our]
eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither
shall there be any more pain."[20] We know that we can be "made perfect
through Jesus ... , who wrought out this perfect atonement,"[21] if we will just
have faith and follow Him.

Toward the end of the inspiring oratorio _Messiah,_ Handel put to beautiful
music the Apostle Paul's words that rejoice over the Resurrection.

"Behold, I [tell] you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be
changed,

"In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: ... the trumpet
shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be
changed.

"For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on
immortality.

"... Then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is
swallowed up in victory.

"O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? ...

"But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus
Christ."[22]

I am grateful for the blessings that are ours because of the Atonement and
Resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ. For all who have laid a child in a
grave or wept over the casket of a spouse or grieved over the death of a
parent or someone they loved, the Resurrection is a source of great hope. What
a powerful experience it will be to see them again--not just as spirits but
with resurrected bodies.

I long to see my mother again and feel her gentle touch and look into her
loving eyes. I want to see my father's smile and hear his laugh and see him as
a resurrected, perfect being. With an eye of faith, I picture Alisa completely
beyond the reach of any earthly troubles or any sting of death--a resurrected,
perfected Alisa, victorious and with a fulness of joy.

A few Easters ago, she wrote simply: "Life through His name. So much hope.
Always. Through everything. I love Easter to remind me."[23]

I testify of the reality of the Resurrection. Jesus Christ lives, and because
of Him, we will all live again. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
