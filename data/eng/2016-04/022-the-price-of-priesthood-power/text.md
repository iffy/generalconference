# The Price of Priesthood Power

Six months ago in the October 2015 general conference, I spoke to the sisters
of the Church about their divine role as women of God. Now I wish to speak to
you brethren about your divine role as men of God. As I travel the world, I
marvel at the strength and sheer goodness of the men and boys of this Church.
There is simply no way to number the hearts you've healed and the lives you've
lifted. Thank you!

In my last conference message, I related my devastating experience many years
ago when, as a heart surgeon, I was not able to save the lives of two little
sisters. With permission of their father, I would like to say more about that
family.

Congenital heart disease afflicted three children born to Ruth and Jimmy
Hatfield. Their first son, Jimmy Jr., died without a definitive diagnosis. I
entered the picture when the parents sought help for their two daughters,
Laural Ann and her younger sister, Gay Lynn. I was heartbroken when both girls
died following their operations.[1] Understandably, Ruth and Jimmy were
spiritually shattered.

Over time, I learned that they harbored lingering resentment toward me and the
Church. For almost six decades, I have been haunted by this situation and have
grieved for the Hatfields. I tried several times to establish contact with
them, without success.

Then one night last May, I was awakened by those two little girls from the
other side of the veil. Though I did not see or hear them with my physical
senses, I felt their presence. Spiritually, I heard their pleadings. Their
message was brief and clear: "Brother Nelson, we are not sealed to anyone!
_Can you help us?_" Soon thereafter, I learned that their mother had passed
away, but their father and younger brother were still alive.

Emboldened by the pleadings of Laural Ann and Gay Lynn, I tried again to
contact their father, who I learned was living with his son Shawn. This time
they were willing to meet with me.

In June, I literally knelt in front of Jimmy, now 88 years old, and had a
heart-to-heart talk with him. I spoke of his daughters' pleadings and told him
I would be honored to perform sealing ordinances for his family. I also
explained that it would take time and much effort on his and Shawn's part to
be ready and worthy to enter the temple, as neither of them had ever been
endowed.

The Spirit of the Lord was palpable throughout that meeting. And when Jimmy
and Shawn each accepted my offer, I was overjoyed! They worked diligently with
their stake president, bishop, home teachers, and ward mission leader, as well
as with young missionaries and a senior missionary couple. And then, not long
ago, in the Payson Utah Temple, I had the profound privilege of sealing Ruth
to Jimmy and their four children to them. Wendy and I wept as we participated
in that sublime experience. Many hearts were healed that day!

On reflection, I have marveled at Jimmy and Shawn and what they were willing
to do. They have become heroes to me. If I could have the wish of my heart, it
would be that each man and young man in this Church would demonstrate the
courage, strength, and humility of this father and son. They were willing to
forgive and let go of old hurts and habits. They were willing to submit to
guidance from their priesthood leaders so that the Atonement of Jesus Christ
could purify and magnify them. Each was willing to become a man who worthily
bears the priesthood "after the holiest order of God."[2]

To _bear _means to support the weight of that which is held. It is a sacred
trust to bear the priesthood, which is the mighty power and authority of God.
Think of this: the priesthood conferred upon us is _the very same power __and
authority_ through which God created this and numberless worlds, governs the
heavens and the earth, and exalts His obedient children.[3]

Recently, Wendy and I were in a meeting where the organist was poised and
ready to play the opening hymn. His eyes were on the music, and his fingers
were on the keys. He began pressing the keys, but there was no sound. I
whispered to Wendy, "He has no power." I reasoned that something had stopped
the flow of electrical power to that organ.

Well, brethren, in like manner, I fear that there are too many men who have
been given the_ authority _of the priesthood but who lack priesthood_ power_
because the flow of power has been blocked by sins such as laziness,
dishonesty, pride, immorality, or preoccupation with things of the world.

I fear that there are too many priesthood bearers who have done little or
nothing to develop their ability to access the powers of heaven. I worry about
all who are impure in their thoughts, feelings, or actions or who demean their
wives or children, thereby cutting off priesthood power.

I fear that too many have sadly surrendered their agency to the adversary and
are saying by their conduct, "I care more about satisfying my own desires than
I do about bearing the Savior's power to bless others."

I fear, brethren, that some among us may one day wake up and realize what
power in the priesthood really is and face the deep regret that they spent far
more time seeking power over others or power at work than learning to exercise
fully the power of God.[4] President George Albert Smith taught that "we are
not here to while away the hours of this life and then pass to a sphere of
exaltation; but we are here to qualify ourselves day by day for the positions
that our Father expects us to fill hereafter."[5]

Why would any man waste his days and settle for Esau's mess of pottage[6] when
he has been entrusted with the possibility of receiving all of the blessings
of Abraham?[7]

I urgently plead with each one of us to live up to our privileges as bearers
of the priesthood. In a coming day, _o__nly _those men who have taken their
priesthood seriously, by _diligently_ seeking to be taught by the Lord
Himself, will be able to bless, guide, protect, strengthen, and heal others.
Only a man who has paid the price for priesthood power will be able to bring
miracles to those he loves and keep his marriage and family safe, now and
throughout eternity.

What is the price to develop such priesthood power? The Savior's senior
Apostle, Peter--that same Peter who with James and John conferred the
Melchizedek Priesthood upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery[8]--declared
qualities we should seek to "be partakers of the divine nature."[9]

He named faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, godliness, brotherly
kindness, charity, and diligence.[10] And don't forget humility![11] So I ask,
how would our family members, friends, and coworkers say you and I are doing
in developing these and other spiritual gifts?[12] The more those attributes
are developed, the greater will be our priesthood power.

How else can we increase our power in the priesthood? We need to pray from our
hearts. Polite recitations of past and upcoming activities, punctuated with
some requests for blessings, cannot constitute the kind of communing with God
that brings enduring power. Are you willing to pray _to know how to pray_ for
more power? The Lord will teach you.

Are you willing to search the scriptures and feast on the words of
Christ[13]--to study _earnestly_ in order to have more power? If you want to
see your wife's heart melt, let her find you on the Internet studying the
doctrine of Christ[14] or reading your scriptures!

Are you willing to worship in the temple regularly? The Lord loves to do His
own teaching in His holy house. Imagine how pleased He would be if you asked
Him to teach you about priesthood keys, authority, and power as you experience
the ordinances of the Melchizedek Priesthood in the holy temple.[15] Imagine
the increase in priesthood power that could be yours.

Are you willing to follow President Thomas S. Monson's example of serving
others? For decades he has taken the long way home, following promptings of
the Spirit to arrive on someone's doorstep and then hear words such as, "How
did you know it was the anniversary of our daughter's death?" or "How did you
know it was my birthday?" And if you truly want more priesthood power, you
will cherish and care for your wife, embracing both her _and_ her counsel.

Now, if all of this sounds excessive, please consider how different our
relationships with our wife, children, and associates at work would be if we
were _as _concerned about gaining priesthood power as we are in progressing at
work or increasing the balance in our bank account. If we will humbly present
ourselves before the Lord and ask Him to teach us, He will show us how to
increase _our _access to _His_ power.

In these latter days, we know there will be earthquakes in diverse places.[16]
Perhaps one of those diverse places will be in our own homes, where emotional,
financial, or spiritual "earthquakes" may occur. Priesthood power can calm the
seas and heal fractures in the earth. Priesthood power can also calm the minds
and heal fractures in the hearts of those we love.

Are we willing to pray, fast, study, seek, worship, and serve as men of God so
we can have that kind of priesthood power? Because two little girls were so
eager to be sealed to their family, their father and brother were willing to
pay the price to bear the holy Melchizedek Priesthood.

My dear brethren, we have been given a sacred trust--the authority of God to
bless others. May each one of us rise up as the man God foreordained us to be
--ready to bear the priesthood of God bravely, eager to pay whatever price is
required to increase his power in the priesthood. With _that _power, we can
help prepare the world for the Second Coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ. This
is His Church, led today by His prophet, President Thomas S. Monson, whom I
dearly love and sustain. I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
