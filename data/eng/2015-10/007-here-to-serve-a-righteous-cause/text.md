# Here to Serve a Righteous Cause

I am grateful that we may gather together with faithful women such as Lisa--
the sister in the video--who are pure in heart, who love the Lord and serve
Him, even amid their own trials. Lisa's story reminds me that we must love one
another and see in one another the beauty of the soul. The Savior taught,
"Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God."[1] Whether we are
age 8 or 108, each of us is "precious in [His] sight."[2] He loves us. We are
daughters of God. We are sisters in Zion. We have a divine nature, and we each
have a glorious work to do.

Over the summer I visited with a lovely young mother of daughters. She shared
with me her feeling that our young women need a cause, something to help them
feel valued. She knew that we may discover our individual and eternal worth by
acting in accordance with our divine purpose in mortality. Tonight, this
beautiful and remarkable choir sang words that teach our purpose. Through test
and trial, even through fear and in the midst of despair, we have valiant
hearts. We are resolved to do our part. We are here to serve a righteous
cause.[3] Sisters, in this cause we are all valued. We are all needed.

The righteous cause we serve is the cause of Christ. It is the work of
salvation.[4] The Lord taught, "This is my work and my glory--to bring to pass
the immortality and eternal life of man."[5] We are the cause for which Jesus
Christ suffered, bled from every pore, and in perfect love gave His life. His
cause is the good news, "the glad tidings, ... that he came into the world, even
Jesus, to be crucified for the world, and to bear the sins of the world, and
to sanctify the world, and to cleanse it from all unrighteousness; that
through him all might be saved."[6] Our Savior has "marked the path and led
the way."[7] I testify that as we follow His example, love God, and serve one
another with kindness and compassion, we may stand in purity, "blameless
before God at the last day."[8] We choose to serve the Lord in His righteous
cause that we may become one with the Father and with the Son.[9]

The prophet Mormon boldly declared, "For we have a labor to perform whilst in
this tabernacle of clay, that we may conquer the enemy of all righteousness,
and rest our souls in the kingdom of God."[10] The early Church leaders and
pioneers of the past pressed forward with heroic courage and determined
faithfulness to establish the restored gospel and build temples where
ordinances of exaltation could be performed. The pioneers of the present,
meaning you and me, also press forward in faith, "to labor in [the Lord's]
vineyard for the salvation of the souls of men."[11] And, as President Gordon
B. Hinckley taught, "How magnificent will be the future as the Almighty rolls
on His glorious work ... through the selfless [service] of those whose hearts
are filled with love for the Redeemer of the world."[12] We join with faithful
sisters of the past, of the present, and of the rising generation when we join
together in the work of salvation!

Before we were born, we accepted our Heavenly Father's plan "by which [we]
could obtain a physical body and gain earthly experience to progress toward
perfection and ultimately realize [our] divine destiny as heirs of eternal
life."[13] Of this premortal covenant, Elder John A. Widtsoe explained: "We
agreed, right then and there, to be not only saviors for ourselves but ...
saviors for the whole human family. We went into a partnership with the Lord.
The working out of the plan became then not merely the Father's work, and the
Savior's work, but also our work. The least of us, the humblest, is in
partnership with the Almighty in achieving the purpose of the eternal plan of
salvation."[14]

Here in mortality we have again covenanted to serve the Savior in the work of
salvation. By participating in sacred priesthood ordinances, we pledge that we
will embark in the service of God with heart, might, mind, and strength.[15]
We receive the Holy Ghost and seek His promptings to guide our efforts.
Righteousness emanates out to the world when we understand what God wants us
to do and then we do it.

I know a Primary child who said to a friend while standing at the bus stop,
"Hey! You ought to come to church with me and learn about Jesus!"

I saw the girls in a Young Women class link arms together and make a
commitment to minister to one another and then plan an appropriate way to help
a young woman who was struggling with an addiction.

I have seen young mothers give everything of their time, their talents, and
their energies to teach and exemplify the principles of the gospel so that
their children, like the sons of Helaman, may stand courageously and
faithfully through trial, temptation, and adversity.

But perhaps most humbling to me was to hear a single adult sister declare with
the fire of pure testimony that the most important work we can do is to
prepare for marriage and family. Although this is not her experience, she
knows that family is the very heart of the work of salvation. "The divine plan
of happiness enables family relationships to be perpetuated beyond the
grave."[16] We honor the Father's plan and glorify God when we strengthen and
ennoble those relationships in the new and everlasting covenant of marriage.
We choose to live pure and virtuous lives so that when the opportunity comes,
we are prepared to make that sacred covenant in the house of the Lord and keep
it forever.

We all experience times and seasons in our lives. But whether we are at
school, at work, in the community, or especially in the home, we are the
Lord's agents and we are on His errand.

In the work of salvation, there is no room for comparison, criticism, or
condemnation. It is not about age, experience, or public acclaim. This sacred
work is about developing a broken heart, a contrite spirit, and a willingness
to use our divine gifts and unique talents to do the Lord's work in His way.
It is having the humility to fall on our knees and say, "O my Father, ... not as
I will, but as thou wilt."[17]

In the strength of the Lord, we "can do all things."[18] We continually seek
His guidance in prayer, in the scriptures, and in the whisperings of the Holy
Ghost. One sister, faced with an overwhelming assignment, wrote, "Sometimes I
wonder if the sisters in the early history of the Church didn't, like us, put
their heads on their pillows at night and pray, 'Whatever tomorrow brings,
will Thou help me through it?'" Then she wrote, "One of the blessings is
[that] we have each other and we are in this together!"[19] Whatever our
circumstances, wherever we are along the path toward salvation, we unite as
one in our commitment to the Savior. We sustain one another in His service.

Recently, you may have read about Sister Ella Hoskins, who at 100 years old
was called to help the young women in her ward with Personal Progress.[20]
About two years later, at 102, Sister Hoskins earned her Young Womanhood
Recognition award. The young women, the ward and stake Young Women and Relief
Society presidencies, and family members gathered together to celebrate her
accomplishment. Boundaries of age, organization, and marital status faded away
in faithful service. Young women expressed gratitude for Sister Hoskins, for
her teaching, and for her righteous example. They want to be like her.
Afterward, I asked Sister Hoskins, "How did you do it?"

She promptly responded, "I repent every day."

From a gentle lady, so full of the Spirit of the Lord that she glowed with
pure light, I was reminded that to shine with the beauty of holiness, to stand
with the Savior, and to bless others, we must be clean. Purity is possible
through the grace of Christ as we deny ungodliness and choose to love God with
might, mind, and strength.[21] The Apostle Paul taught, "Flee ... youthful
lusts: ... follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on
the Lord out of a pure heart."[22] None of us is perfect. We have all made
mistakes. But we repent so that we may be better and "retain the name [of
Christ] written always in [our] hearts."[23] When we serve in the name of the
Lord, with purity of heart, we reflect the Savior's love and give others a
glimpse of heaven.

May we choose to serve a righteous cause as valiant emissaries of our Lord
Jesus Christ. Let us stand together and "with a song in [our] heart[s] move
forward, living the gospel, loving the Lord, and building [His] kingdom."[24]
I testify that in this glorious work, we may know the pure love of God. We may
receive true joy and obtain all the glories of eternity. In the sacred name of
Jesus Christ, amen.
