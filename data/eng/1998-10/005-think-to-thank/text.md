# Think to Thank

In a land far away, and at a time long ago, Jesus journeyed to Jerusalem. "He
passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.

"And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were
lepers, which stood afar off:

"And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.

"And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go shew yourselves unto the priests.
And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed.

"And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud
voice glorified God,

"And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a
Samaritan.

"And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the
nine?

"There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger.

"And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole."[1]

From the 30th Psalm, David pledges, "O Lord my God, I will give thanks unto
thee for ever."[2]

The Apostle Paul, in his epistle to the Corinthians, proclaimed, "Thanks be
unto God for his unspeakable gift."[3] And to the Thessalonians, "In every
thing give thanks: for this is the will of God."[4]

My brothers and sisters, do we give thanks to God "for his unspeakable gift"
and His rich blessings so abundantly bestowed upon us?

Do we pause and ponder Ammon's words? "Now my brethren, we see that God is
mindful of every people, whatsoever land they may be in; yea, he numbereth his
people, ... over all the earth. Now this is my joy, and my great thanksgiving;
yea, and I will give thanks unto my God forever."[5]

Robert W. Woodruff, a prominent business leader of a former time, toured the
United States giving a lecture which he entitled "A Capsule Course in Human
Relations." In his message, he said that the two most important words in the
English language are these: "Thank you."

_Gracias, danke, merci_--whatever language is spoken, "thank you" frequently
expressed will cheer your spirit, broaden your friendships, and lift your
lives to a higher pathway as you journey toward perfection. There is a
simplicity--even a sincerity--when "thank you" is spoken.

The beauty and eloquence of an expression of gratitude is reflected in a
newspaper story of some years ago:

_The District of Columbia police auctioned off about 100 unclaimed bicycles
Friday. "One dollar," said an 11-year-old boy as the bidding opened on the
first bike. The bidding, however, went much higher. "One dollar," the boy
repeated hopefully each time another bike came up._

_The auctioneer, who had been auctioning stolen or lost bikes for 43 years,
noticed that the boy's hopes seemed to soar higher whenever a racer-type
bicycle was put up._

_Then there was just one racer left. The bidding went to eight dollars. "Sold
to that boy over there for nine dollars!" said the auctioneer. He took eight
dollars from his own pocket and asked the boy for his dollar. The youngster
turned it over in pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters--took his bike, and
started to leave. But he went only a few feet. Carefully parking his new
possession, he went back, gratefully threw his arms around the auctioneer's
neck, and cried._

When was the last time we felt gratitude as deeply as did this boy? The deeds
others perform in our behalf might not be as poignant, but certainly there are
kind acts that warrant our expressions of gratitude.

The song frequently sung in the Sunday School of our youth placed the spirit
of thanksgiving into the depths of our souls:

_When upon life's billows you are tempest tossed,_

_When you are discouraged, thinking all is lost,_

_Count your many blessings; name them one by one,_

_And it will surprise you what the Lord has done._[6]

Astronaut Gordon Cooper, while orbiting the earth over 30 years ago, offered
this sweet and simple prayer of thanks: "Father, thank You, especially for
letting me fly this flight. Thank You for the privilege of being able to be in
this position: to be up in this wondrous place, seeing all these many
startling, wonderful things that You have created."[7]

We are thankful for blessings we cannot measure, for gifts we cannot appraise,
"for books, music, art, and for the great inventions which make these
blessings available ... ; for the laughter of little children; ... for the ... means
for relieving human suffering ... and increasing ... the enjoyment of life; ... for
everything good and uplifting."[8]

The prophet Alma urged, "Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and he will
direct thee for good; yea, when thou liest down at night lie down unto the
Lord, that he may watch over you in your sleep; and when thou risest in the
morning let thy heart be full of thanks unto God; and if ye do these things,
ye shall be lifted up at the last day."[9]

I would like to mention three instances where I believe a sincere "thank you"
could lift a heavy heart, inspire a good deed, and bring heaven's blessings
closer to the challenges of our day.

First, may I ask that we express thanks to our parents for life, for caring,
for sacrificing, for laboring to provide a knowledge of our Heavenly Father's
plan for happiness.

From Sinai the words thunder to our conscience, "Honour thy father and thy
mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth
thee."[10]

I know of no sweeter expression toward a parent than that spoken by our Savior
upon the cross: "When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple
standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!

"Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that
disciple took her unto his own home."[11]

Next, have we thought on occasion of a certain teacher at school or at church
who seemed to quicken our desire to learn, who instilled in us a commitment to
live with honor?

The story is told of a group of men who were talking about people who had
influenced their lives and for whom they were grateful. One man thought of a
high school teacher who had introduced him to Tennyson. He decided to write
and thank her. In time, written in a feeble scrawl, came the teacher's reply:

"My dear Willie:

"I can't tell you how much your note meant to me. I am in my 80s, living alone
in a small room, cooking my own meals, lonely and like the last leaf lingering
behind. You will be interested to know that I taught school for 50 years, and
yours is the first note of appreciation I have ever received. It came on a
blue, cold morning, and it cheered me as nothing has for years."

We owe an eternal debt of gratitude to all of those, past and present, who
have given so much of themselves, that we might have so much ourselves.

Third, I mention an expression of "thank you" to one's peers. The teenage
years can be difficult for the teens themselves as well as for their parents.
These are trying times in the life of a boy or a girl. Each boy wants to make
the football team; each girl wants to be the beauty queen. "Many are called,
but few are chosen"[12] could have an application here.

Let me share with you a modern-day miracle which occurred a year or so ago at
Murray High School near Salt Lake City, where every person was a winner, and
not a loser was to be found.

A newspaper article highlighted the event. It was entitled "Homecoming Shows
True Spirit: Students Elect 2 Disabled Girls to Murray Royalty." The article
began, "Ted and Ruth Eyre did what any parents would do. When their daughter,
Shellie, became a finalist for Murray High School homecoming queen, they
counseled her to be a good sport in case she didn't win. They explained only
one girl among the 10 would be selected queen. ... As student body officers
crowned the school's homecoming [royalty] in the school gym Thursday night,
Shellie Eyre experienced, instead, inclusion. The 17-year-old senior, born
with Down syndrome, was selected by fellow students as homecoming queen. ... As
Ted Eyre escorted his daughter onto the gym floor as the candidates were
introduced, the gym erupted into deafening cheers and applause. They were
greeted with a standing ovation."

Similar standing ovations were extended to Shellie's attendants, one of whom,
April Pershon, has physical and mental disabilities resulting from a brain
hemorrhage suffered when she was just 10 years old.

When the ovations had ceased, the school vice principal, Glo Merrill, said,
"'Tonight ... the students voted on inner beauty.' ... Obviously moved, parents,
school administrators and students wept openly." Said one student, "'I'm so
happy, I cried when they came out. I think Murray High is so awesome to do
this.'"[13]

I extend a heartfelt "thank you" to one and all who made this night one ever
to be remembered. The Scottish poet James Barrie's words seem appropriate:
"God gave us memories, that we might have June roses in the December of our
lives."

In August of this year, there occurred a tragedy in Salt Lake County. It was
reported in the local and national press. Five beautiful little girls--so
young, so vibrant, so loving--hiding away, as children often do in their games
of hide-and-seek, entered the trunk of a parent's car. The trunk lid was
pulled shut, they were unable to escape, and all perished from heat
exhaustion.

The entire community was so kind, so thoughtful, so caring in the passing of
Alisha, Ashley, McKell, Audrey, and Jaesha. Flowers, food, calls, visits, and
prayers were shared.

On the Sunday after the devastating event occurred, long lines of automobiles
filled with grieving occupants drove ever so slowly past the Smith home--the
scene of the accident. Sister Monson and I wished to be among those who
expressed condolences in this way. As we drove by, we felt we were on holy
ground. We literally crept along at a snail's pace along the street. It was as
though we could visualize a traffic sign reading, "Please drive slowly;
children at play." Tears filled our eyes and compassion flowed from our
hearts.

At the funeral, as well as the evening prior, thousands passed by the caskets
and expressed support for the grieving parents and grandparents. In two of the
three families, the deceased children were all the children they had.

Frequently death comes as an intruder. It is an enemy that suddenly appears in
the midst of life's feast, putting out its lights and gaiety. It visits the
aged as they walk on faltering feet. Its summons is heard by those who have
scarcely reached midway in life's journey, and often it hushes the laughter of
little children.

At the funeral services for the five little angels, I counseled: "There is one
phrase which should be erased from your thinking and from the words you speak
aloud. It is the phrase, 'If only.' It is counterproductive and is not
conducive to the spirit of healing and of peace. Rather, recall the words of
Proverbs: 'Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own
understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy
paths.'[14]"

Before the closing of the caskets, I noted that each child held a favorite
toy, a soft gift to cuddle. I reflected on the words of the poet Eugene Field:

_The little toy dog is covered with dust,_

_But sturdy and staunch he stands;_

_And the little toy soldier is red with rust,_

_And his musket moulds in his hands._

_Time was when the little toy dog was new,_

_And the soldier was passing fair,_

_And that was the time when our Little Boy Blue_

_Kissed them and put them there._

_"Now, don't you go till I come," he said,_

_"And don't you make any noise!"_

_So toddling off to his trundle-bed_

_He dreamt of the pretty toys._

_And as he was dreaming, an angel song_

_Awakened our Little Boy Blue,--_

_Oh, the years are many, the years are long,_

_But the little toy friends are true!_

_Ay, faithful to Little Boy Blue they stand,_

_Each in the same old place,_

_Awaiting the touch of a little hand,_

_The smile of a little face._

_And they wonder, as waiting the long years through,_

_In the dust of that little chair,_

_What has become of our Little Boy Blue_

_Since he kissed them and put them there._[15]

The little toy dog and the soldier fair may wonder, but God in His infinite
mercy has not left grieving loved ones to wonder. He has provided truth. He
will inspire an upward reach, and His outstretched arms will embrace you.
Jesus promises to one and all who grieve, "I will not leave you comfortless: I
will come to you."[16]

There is only one source of true peace. I am certain that the Lord, who notes
the fall of a sparrow, looks with compassion upon those who have been called
upon to part--even temporarily--from their precious children. The gifts of
healing and of peace are desperately needed, and Jesus, through His Atonement,
has provided them for one and all.

The Prophet Joseph Smith spoke inspired words of revelation and comfort:

"All children who die before they arrive at the years of accountability are
saved in the celestial kingdom of heaven."[17]

"The mother [and father] who laid down [their] little child[ren], being
deprived of the privilege, the joy, and the satisfaction of bringing [them] up
to manhood or womanhood in this world, would, after the resurrection, have all
the joy, satisfaction and pleasure, and even more than it would have been
possible to have had in mortality, in seeing [their] child[ren] grow to the
full measure of the stature of [their] spirit[s]."[18] This is as the balm of
Gilead to those who grieve, to those who have loved and lost precious
children.

The Psalmist provided this assurance: "Weeping may endure for a night, but joy
cometh in the morning."[19]

Said the Lord: "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the
world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it
be afraid. ... In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I
would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you ... that where I am, there
ye may be also."[20]

I express my profound thanks to a loving Heavenly Father who gives to you, to
me, and to all who sincerely seek, the knowledge that death is not the end,
that His Son--even our Savior, Jesus Christ--died that we might live. Temples
of the Lord dot the lands of many countries. Sacred covenants are made.
Celestial glory awaits the obedient. Families can be together--forever.

The Master invites one and all:

"Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you
rest.

"Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and
ye shall find rest unto your souls."[21]

That all may do so is my humble prayer of thanks, in the name of Jesus Christ,
amen.
