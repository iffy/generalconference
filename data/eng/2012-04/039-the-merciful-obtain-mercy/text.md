# The Merciful Obtain Mercy

My dear brothers and sisters, not long ago I received a letter from a
concerned mother who pleaded for a general conference talk on a topic that
would specifically benefit her two children. A rift had grown between them,
and they had stopped speaking to each other. The mother was heartbroken. In
the letter she assured me that a general conference message on this topic
would reconcile her children, and all would be well.

This good sister's sincere and heartfelt plea was just one of several
promptings I have received over these last months that I should say a few
words today on a topic that is a growing concern--not only for a worried
mother but for many in the Church and, indeed, the world.

I am impressed by the faith of this loving mother that a general conference
talk could help heal the relationship between her children. I am sure that her
confidence was not so much in the abilities of the speakers but in "the virtue
of the word of God," which has a "more powerful effect upon the minds of the
people than ... anything else."[1] Dear sister, I pray that the Spirit will
touch your children's hearts.

## When Relationships Go Bad

Strained and broken relationships are as old as humankind itself. Ancient Cain
was the first who allowed the cancer of bitterness and malice to canker his
heart. He tilled the ground of his soul with envy and hatred and allowed these
feelings to ripen until he did the unthinkable--murdering his own brother and
becoming, in the process, the father of Satan's lies.[2]

Since those first days the spirit of envy and hatred has led to some of the
most tragic stories in history. It turned Saul against David, the sons of
Jacob against their brother Joseph, Laman and Lemuel against Nephi, and
Amalickiah against Moroni.

I imagine that every person on earth has been affected in some way by the
destructive spirit of contention, resentment, and revenge. Perhaps there are
even times when we recognize this spirit in ourselves. When we feel hurt,
angry, or envious, it is quite easy to judge other people, often assigning
dark motives to their actions in order to justify our own feelings of
resentment.

## The Doctrine

Of course, we know this is wrong. The doctrine is clear. We all depend on the
Savior; none of us can be saved without Him. Christ's Atonement is infinite
and eternal. Forgiveness for _our_ sins comes with conditions. We must repent,
and we must be willing to forgive others. Jesus taught: "Forgive one another;
for he that forgiveth not ... [stands] condemned before the Lord; for there
remaineth in him the greater sin"[3] and "Blessed are the merciful: for they
shall obtain mercy."[4]

Of course, these words seem perfectly reasonable--when applied to someone
else. We can so clearly and easily see the harmful results that come when
_others_ judge and hold grudges. And we certainly don't like it when people
judge us.

But when it comes to our own prejudices and grievances, we too often justify
our anger as righteous and our judgment as reliable and only appropriate.
Though we cannot look into another's heart, we assume that we know a bad
motive or even a bad person when we see one. We make exceptions when it comes
to our own bitterness because we feel that, in our case, we have all the
information we need to hold someone else in contempt.

The Apostle Paul, in his letter to the Romans, said that those who pass
judgment on others are "inexcusable." The moment we judge someone else, he
explained, we condemn ourselves, for none is without sin.[5] Refusing to
forgive is a grievous sin--one the Savior warned against. Jesus's own
disciples had "sought occasion against [each other] and forgave not one
another in their hearts; and for this evil they were afflicted and sorely
chastened."[6]

Our Savior has spoken so clearly on this subject that there is little room for
private interpretation. "I, the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive," but
then He said, "... of you it is _required_ to forgive _all_ men."[7]

May I add a footnote here? When the Lord requires that we forgive all men,
that includes forgiving ourselves. Sometimes, of all the people in the world,
the one who is the hardest to forgive--as well as perhaps the one who is most
in need of our forgiveness--is the person looking back at us in the mirror.

## The Bottom Line

This topic of judging others could actually be taught in a two-word sermon.
When it comes to hating, gossiping, ignoring, ridiculing, holding grudges, or
wanting to cause harm, please apply the following:

Stop it!

It's that simple. We simply have to stop judging others and replace judgmental
thoughts and feelings with a heart full of love for God and His children. God
is our Father. We are His children. We are all brothers and sisters. I don't
know exactly how to articulate this point of _not judging others_ with
sufficient eloquence, passion, and persuasion to make it stick. I can quote
scripture, I can try to expound doctrine, and I will even quote a bumper
sticker I recently saw. It was attached to the back of a car whose driver
appeared to be a little rough around the edges, but the words on the sticker
taught an insightful lesson. It read, "Don't judge me because I sin
differently than you."

We must recognize that we are all imperfect--that we are beggars before God.
Haven't we all, at one time or another, meekly approached the mercy seat and
pleaded for grace? Haven't we wished with all the energy of our souls for
mercy--to be forgiven for the mistakes we have made and the sins we have
committed?

Because we all depend on the mercy of God, how can we deny to others any
measure of the grace we so desperately desire for ourselves? My beloved
brothers and sisters, should we not forgive as we wish to be forgiven?

## The Love of God

Is this difficult to do?

Yes, of course.

Forgiving ourselves and others is not easy. In fact, for most of us it
requires a major change in our attitude and way of thinking--even a change of
heart. But there is good news. This "mighty change"[8] of heart is exactly
what the gospel of Jesus Christ is designed to bring into our lives.

How is it done? Through the love of God.

When our hearts are filled with the love of God, something good and pure
happens to us. We "keep his commandments: and his commandments are not
grievous. For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world."[9]

The more we allow the love of God to govern our minds and emotions--the more
we allow our love for our Heavenly Father to swell within our hearts--the
easier it is to love others with the pure love of Christ. As we open our
hearts to the glowing dawn of the love of God, the darkness and cold of
animosity and envy will eventually fade.

As always, Christ is our exemplar. In His teachings as in His life, He showed
us the way. He forgave the wicked, the vulgar, and those who sought to hurt
and to do Him harm.

Jesus said it is easy to love those who love us; even the wicked can do
_that._ But Jesus Christ taught a higher law. His words echo through the
centuries and are meant for us today. They are meant for all who desire to be
His disciples. They are meant for you and me: "Love your enemies, bless them
that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which
despitefully use you, and persecute you."[10]

When our hearts are filled with the love of God, we become "kind one to
another, tenderhearted, forgiving [each other], even as God for Christ's sake
[forgave us]."[11]

The pure love of Christ can remove the scales of resentment and wrath from our
eyes, allowing us to see others the way our Heavenly Father sees us: as flawed
and imperfect mortals who have potential and worth far beyond our capacity to
imagine. Because God loves us so much, we too must love and forgive each
other.

## The Way of the Disciple

My dear brothers and sisters, consider the following questions as a self-test:

Do you harbor a grudge against someone else?

Do you gossip, even when what you say may be true?

Do you exclude, push away, or punish others because of something they have
done?

Do you secretly envy another?

Do you wish to cause harm to someone?

If you answered yes to any of these questions, you may want to apply the two-
word sermon from earlier: stop it!

In a world of accusations and unfriendliness, it is easy to gather and cast
stones. But before we do so, let us remember the words of the One who is our
Master and model: "He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a
stone."[12]

Brothers and sisters, let us put down our stones.

Let us be kind.

Let us forgive.

Let us talk peacefully with each other.

Let the love of God fill our hearts.

"Let us do good unto all men."[13]

The Savior promised: "Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure,
pressed down, and shaken together, and running over. ... For with the same
measure that [you use] it shall be measured to you again."[14]

Shouldn't this promise be enough to always focus our efforts on acts of
kindness, forgiveness, and charity instead of on any negative behavior?

Let us, as disciples of Jesus Christ, return good for evil.[15] Let us not
seek revenge or allow our wrath to overcome us.

"For it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.

"Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink. ...

"Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."[16]

Remember: in the end, it is the merciful who obtain mercy.[17]

As members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, wherever we may
be, let us be known as a people who "have love one to another."[18]

## Love One Another

Brothers and sisters, there is enough heartache and sorrow in this life
without our adding to it through our own stubbornness, bitterness, and
resentment.

We are not perfect.

The people around us are not perfect.[19] People do things that annoy,
disappoint, and anger. In this mortal life it will always be that way.

Nevertheless, we must let go of our grievances. Part of the purpose of
mortality is to learn how to let go of such things. _That is the Lord's way._

Remember, heaven is filled with those who have this in common: They are
forgiven. And they forgive.

Lay your burden at the Savior's feet. Let go of judgment. Allow Christ's
Atonement to change and heal your heart. Love one another. Forgive one
another.

The merciful will obtain mercy.

Of this I testify in the name of the One who loved so well and so completely
that He gave His life for us, His friends--in the sacred name of Jesus Christ,
amen.
