# The Sustaining of Church Officers

We note with regret the passing of President N. Eldon Tanner, who at the time
of his death was serving as First Counselor in the First Presidency. Following
President Tanner's death, President Spencer W. Kimball designated President
Marion G. Romney as his First Counselor and President Gordon B. Hinckley as
his Second Counselor. And this action was later approved by the Council of the
First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve. In view of this, it is proposed
that we sustain President Marion G. Romney as First Counselor in the First
Presidency, and President Gordon B. Hinckley as Second Counselor in the First
Presidency.

All in favor, please manifest it.

Any opposed may so manifest it.

With the exception of these brethren we have just sustained, and noting the
passing of our dear friend and brother, Elder LeGrand Richards of the Quorum
of the Twelve, there have been no changes in the General Authorities since the
last conference. It is proposed, therefore, that we sustain all of the General
Authorities and general officers of the Church as at present constituted.

Those in favor, please manifest it.

Those opposed, by the same sign.
