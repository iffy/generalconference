# Closing Remarks

My beloved brothers and sisters, we now conclude a great conference. We have
been edified, uplifted. We have been inspired and lifted to a higher
appreciation of this wonderful gospel. The music, the spoken word, and the
prayers have all been magnificent.

We now return to our homes. If we are driving, let us be careful. Let no
tragedy mar the experience we have enjoyed.

All of the proceedings of this conference will appear in a subsequent issue of
the _Ensign_ and _Liahona._ We encourage you again to read the talks in your
family home evenings and discuss them together as families. They are the
products of much prayer and meditation and are well worthy of careful
consideration.

Now the conference is adjourned for six months. We look forward to seeing you
again next April. I'm 97, but I hope I'm going to make it. May the blessings
of heaven attend you in the meantime is our humble and sincere prayer in the
name of our Redeemer, even the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.
