# Scriptural Witnesses

We express love and admiration for President Henry B. Eyring, Elder Quentin L.
Cook, and Elder Walter F. Gonzalez and pray for the Lord's blessings to attend
them in their new callings.

We extend heartfelt feelings of gratitude to each of you, brothers and
sisters. Throughout the world, your examples of service and compassion are
receiving a great deal of attention. At the same time, many people are
wondering about this Church's history and doctrines. Among those questioners
are some who choose to cast aspersions at the Book of Mormon.[1]

Disregard for the Book of Mormon or for any other sacred scripture concerns me
deeply. In addressing that concern, I have titled my remarks "Scriptural
Witnesses."

## Definitions

I will define the term _scriptural_ as pertaining to the Bible and the
scriptures of the Restoration.[2] Members of the Church "believe the Bible to
be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly; we also believe the
Book of Mormon to be the word of God."[3] Scriptures of the Restoration also
include the Doctrine and Covenants as well as the Pearl of Great Price.

A dictionary defines the noun _witness_ as an "attestation of a fact or event:
[a] testimony."[4] The term _witness_ bears special significance when applied
to the word of God. In the Bible we read this important declaration: "In the
mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established."[5] This
assures God's children that divine doctrines are confirmed by more than one
scriptural witness.

## Scriptures Testify of Jesus Christ

The Bible and the Book of Mormon are both witnesses of Jesus Christ. They
teach that He is the Son of God, that He lived an exemplary life, that He
atoned for all mankind, that He died upon the cross and rose again as the
resurrected Lord. They teach that He is the Savior of the world.

Scriptural witnesses authenticate each other. This concept was explained long
ago when a prophet wrote that the Book of Mormon was "written for the intent
that ye may believe [the Bible]; and if ye believe [the Bible] ye will believe
[the Book of Mormon] also."[6] Each book refers to the other. Each book stands
as evidence that God lives and speaks to His children by revelation to His
prophets.[7]

Love for the Book of Mormon expands one's love for the Bible and vice versa.
Scriptures of the Restoration do not compete with the Bible; they complement
the Bible. We are indebted to martyrs who gave their lives so that we could
have the Bible. It establishes the everlasting nature of the gospel and of the
plan of happiness. The Book of Mormon restores and underscores biblical
doctrines such as tithing,[8] the temple,[9] the Sabbath day,[10] and the
priesthood.[11]

An angel proclaimed that the Book of Mormon[12] shall establish the truth of
the Bible.[13] He also revealed that writings in the Bible available in our
day are not as complete as they were when originally written by prophets and
apostles.[14] He declared that the Book of Mormon shall restore plain and
precious things taken away from the Bible.[15]

A prophecy in the Book of Mormon warned that some people would object to the
notion of additional scriptures. To those who think they "need no more
Bible,"[16] consider this God-given counsel:

"Know ye not that there are more nations than one? Know ye not that I, the
Lord your God, ... created all men, ... and that I rule in the heavens above and
in the earth beneath; and I bring forth my word unto the children of men, yea,
even upon all the nations of the earth?

"... Know ye not that the testimony of two nations is a witness unto you that I
am God, that I remember one nation like unto another? Wherefore, I speak the
same words unto one nation like unto another. And ... the testimony of the two
nations shall run together also."[17]

The scriptural story of Jesus Christ is indeed a two-hemisphere story.[18]
While Mary and Joseph in the East were making preparations for the holy
child's birth in Bethlehem,[19] Nephi in the West was being taught by the
premortal Messiah. To Nephi the Lord said, "Be of good cheer; ... on the morrow
come I into the world, to show unto the world that I will fulfil all that
which I have caused to be spoken by the mouth of my holy prophets."[20]

To doubters of that second witness--the Book of Mormon--the Lord issued a
warning: "Because you have treated lightly the things you have received ...
[you] shall remain under ... condemnation until [you] repent and remember ... the
Book of Mormon and the former commandments which I have given ..., [the Bible,
and] ... do according to that which I have written."[21]

The Lord provided other scriptures of the Restoration[22] and declared that
those words will also be fulfilled.[23] With these scriptural witnesses, false
doctrines will be confounded.[24] With these scriptural witnesses, doctrines
of the Bible are not only reaffirmed but clarified.

## Restoration Scriptures Clarify the Bible

How do scriptures of the Restoration clarify the Bible? Many examples exist. I
will cite but a few, beginning with the Old Testament.

Isaiah wrote, "Thou shalt ... speak out of the ground, and thy speech shall be
low out of the dust, and thy voice shall be, as of one that hath a familiar
spirit, out of the ground, and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust."[25]
Could any words be more descriptive of the Book of Mormon, coming as it did
"out of the ground" to "whisper out of the dust" to people of our day?[26]

But Isaiah was not the only Old Testament prophet who foretold the Book of
Mormon. Ezekiel wrote:

"Take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of
Israel ... : then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick
of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel ... :

"And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in
thine hand."[27]

Today, Saints living in many nations of the earth gratefully hold the Bible
(the stick of Judah) and the Book of Mormon (the stick of Ephraim) bound as
one in their hands.

What about the New Testament? The Book of Mormon also stands as a scriptural
witness to its teachings. Examples include the miraculous birth of the babe in
Bethlehem,[28] His Sermon on the Mount,[29] and the intense suffering of the
Savior.[30] The doctrine of the Resurrection is mentioned more frequently in
the Book of Mormon than in the Bible.[31]

The need for the Holy Ghost was mentioned by Paul. He asked, "Have ye received
the Holy Ghost ... ? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard
whether there be any Holy Ghost."[32] That doctrine is clarified by another
scriptural witness, conveyed through the Lord's prophet of the Restoration. He
taught us to "believe in the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of
hands."[33] That precious and powerful gift is again available to children of
God.

Paul referred to the three degrees of postmortal glory when he taught that
"there is one glory of the sun, ... another glory of the moon, and another glory
of the stars."[34] That glimpse into postmortal glory has been clarified by
another scriptural witness. The Lord revealed that "the glory of the celestial
is one, even as the glory of the sun is one.

"And the glory of the terrestrial is one, even as the glory of the moon is
one.

"And the glory of the telestial is one, even as the glory of the stars is
one."[35]

The highest of these kingdoms, the celestial, is reserved for those who obey
the law of that kingdom:

"They who are not sanctified through the law ... of Christ, must inherit another
kingdom, even that of a terrestrial kingdom, or that of a telestial kingdom.

"For he who is not able to abide the law of a celestial kingdom cannot abide a
celestial glory."[36]

These three degrees of glory relate to postmortal life. They relate to the
immortality of the human soul. That gift of immortality became a reality
because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ.[37] This important word--_atonement_
--in any of its forms, is mentioned only _once_ in the King James Version of
the New Testament![38] In the Book of Mormon, it appears 39 times![39]

John, writing in the New Testament's book of Revelation, foresaw "another
angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto
them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue,
and people."[40] One specific angel held keys of responsibility for the Book
of Mormon.[41] That was the angel Moroni! These examples are but a few of many
biblical doctrines that are clarified by scriptures of the Restoration.[42]

## The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ

Willingly we share scriptures of the Restoration with people across the world.
The Book of Mormon records the personal ministry of the resurrected Lord to
people of ancient America. Ponder these everlasting truths that He proclaimed:

"Behold, I am Jesus Christ the Son of God. I created the heavens and the
earth, and all things that in them are. I was with the Father from the
beginning. ...

"... The scriptures concerning my coming are fulfilled. ...

"I am the light and the life of the world."

The Savior continued:

"Whoso cometh unto me with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, him will I
baptize with fire and with the Holy Ghost. ...

"... I have come unto the world to bring redemption unto the world, to save the
world from sin.

"Therefore, whoso repenteth and cometh unto me as a little child, him will I
receive, for of such is the kingdom of God. ... I have laid down my life, and
have taken it up again; therefore repent, and come unto me ... and be
saved."[43]

Those declarations of the Lord summarize who He really is and who He really
wants us to be. He wants us to come unto Him and, in due course, be embraced
gloriously in His loving arms.

I express my profound gratitude for scriptural witnesses. I have seen the
mighty change that comes to people who apply the Lord's teachings in their
lives. Such transformation leads to the blessing of eternal life.[44]

I know that God lives. Jesus is the Christ. His gospel has been restored in
these latter days. President Gordon B. Hinckley is His prophet at this time. I
so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

  25. [Isaiah 29:4](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/isa/29.4?lang=eng#3).

  26. Isaiah foresaw that God would do "a marvellous work and a wonder" in the latter days ([Isaiah 29:14](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/isa/29.14?lang=eng#13)). Those words of Isaiah echoed in the ears of inhabitants of ancient America: "The Lord will set his hand again the second time to restore his people from their lost and fallen state. Wherefore, he will proceed to do a marvelous work and a wonder among the children of men" ([2 Nephi 25:17](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.17?lang=eng#16)). That marvelous work would include the coming forth of the Book of Mormon and the Restoration of the gospel. Isaiah was quoted frequently in the Book of Mormon. A study of those quotations may be tedious, but it is _not_ repetitious. Of 433 verses of Isaiah in the Book of Mormon, 234 differ from their biblical counterparts.

That doctrine is clarified in the Book of Mormon. It bears record of the resurrected Lord speaking to people of ancient America. There the Lord said, "Ye are they of whom I said: Other sheep I have which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd" ([3 Nephi 15:21](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/15.21?lang=eng#20)).
