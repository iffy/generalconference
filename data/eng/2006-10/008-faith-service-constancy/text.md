# Faith, Service, Constancy

Thirty-nine years ago two of the Lord's missionaries knocked on my family's
door in Glasgow, Scotland. We were deeply touched by their brightness, their
humility, and their faith. Whenever they were in our home, we felt love and
peace. It was a feeling of sheer goodness.

Their teaching was personal, sincere, familiar. We simply felt that it was
true. A few weeks later we were baptized and confirmed and were immediately
embraced with friendship and kindness from members and leaders in our new
Church family.

So began a gospel journey which has enriched and blessed every aspect of our
lives, bringing a deep, abiding, calming sense of purpose and direction. In
the hope that it may prove helpful to those new to Church membership, I will
share today just three gospel fundamentals learned along the way.

First is the motivating, transforming power of faith in Jesus Christ. Such
faith is like spiritual oxygen. As we allow faith to freely flow within us, it
awakens and enlivens our spiritual senses. It breathes life into our very
souls.

As faith flows, we become sensitively attuned to the whisperings of the
Spirit. Our minds are enlightened, our spiritual pulse quickens, our hearts
are touched.

Faith fuels hope. Our perspective changes; our vision becomes clearer. We
begin to look for the best, not the worst, in life and in others. We gain a
deeper sense of life's purpose and meaning. Despair gives way to joy.

Faith such as this is a heavenly gift, but it can be sought and cultivated. As
our Bible Dictionary suggests, often "faith is kindled by hearing the
testimony of those who have faith." [1]  Faith is then nurtured as we allow
ourselves to believe. Like all other virtues, faith is strengthened as we
practice it, as we live and act as if our faith were already deep. Faith is
the product of righteous desire, belief, and obedience.

Thus the Book of Mormon example of the father of King Lamoni, who heard the
testimony of Aaron and was willing to believe and to act so that he was led to
say in humble prayer, "If there is a God, and if thou art God, wilt thou make
thyself known unto me, and I will give away all my sins to know thee." [2]

So it can be for us as we allow ourselves to be touched by the spirit of
testimony, as we exercise belief, as we desire, ponder, seek--as we cultivate
our faith.

Second, as we serve we grow. President George Albert Smith taught, "It is not
what we receive that enriches our lives, it is what we give." [3]

Selfless service is a wonderful antidote to the ills that flow from the
worldwide epidemic of self-indulgence. Some grow bitter or anxious when it
seems that not enough attention is being paid to them, when their lives would
be so enriched if only they paid more attention to the needs of others.

The answer lies in helping to solve the problems of those around us rather
than worrying about our own, living to lift burdens even when we ourselves
feel weighed down, putting our shoulder to the wheel instead of complaining
that the wagons of life seem to be passing us by.

Stretching our souls in service helps us to rise above our cares, concerns,
and challenges. As we focus our energies on lifting the burdens of others,
something miraculous happens. Our own burdens diminish. We become happier.
There is more substance to our lives.

Third, discipleship does not guarantee freedom from the storms of life. Even
as we are wending our way carefully and faithfully along the strait and narrow
path, we encounter obstacle and challenge. There are days, perhaps even months
and years, when life is just hard. We experience our fair share of adversity,
heartache, loneliness, pain, grief--sometimes, it seems, more than our fair
share.

What to do when adversity strikes? There is only one thing to do. Stand steady
and see it through. Stay steadfast, constant, and true. The real tragedy in
the whirlwinds of life comes only when we allow them to blow us off our true
course.

At these moments of crisis and challenge, some choose to abandon faith just at
the time when it most needs to be embraced. Prayer is ignored at the very hour
when it needs to be intensified. Virtue is carelessly tossed aside when it
needs to be cherished. God is forsaken in the all-too-human yet mistaken fear
that He has forsaken us.

The truth is that our only safety, our only security, our only hope is to hold
fast to that which is good. As the mists of darkness gather around us, we are
only lost if we choose to let go of the iron rod, which is the word of God.

The Savior's parable of the wise man who built his house upon a rock has power
precisely because it illustrates that life's challenges befell the wise man
too. The rains fell, the winds blew, the floods rose up. Yet he survived it
all because he had built upon a sure foundation and, crucially, he stayed
there when the storm came.

In his description of a pilgrim's, or disciple's, progress, John Bunyan wrote:

_Who would true valour see,_

_Let him come hither!_

_One here will constant be,_

_Come wind, come weather;_

_There's no discouragement_

_Shall make him once relent_

_His first avowed intent_

_To be a pilgrim._ [4]

The Apostle Paul urged the Colossians to "continue in the faith grounded and
settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have
heard." [5]

To the people of Corinth came this powerful testimony:

"We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not
in despair;

"Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed." [6]

What made such a perspective possible? Paul gave the reason: "For God, who
commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to
give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus
Christ." [7]

It is my witness that as we cultivate our faith, grow through service, and
stay constant and true come what may, so we feel the Savior's love. We place
ourselves in the position where we can access the breadth and depth of the
blessings of the Atonement. Our membership is transformed into discipleship.
We are strengthened, cleansed, refreshed, spiritually and emotionally healed.

Of this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
