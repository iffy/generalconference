# New Emphasis on Church Councils

President Kimball has asked me to introduce to you an expansion of the
procedure for conducting Church affairs at the area and region levels. With
the increased growth and internationalization of the Church and the great
responsibility to promote the ecclesiastical and temporal work throughout the
world in a more unified fashion, we are introducing an emphasis on the role of
councils in Church government.

This action will maintain the orderly management of Church activity at all
administrative levels. President Ezra Taft Benson, of the Council of the
Twelve, and Bishop Victor L. Brown, Presiding Bishop of the Church, will
explain details and indicate how this modification is to be implemented in the
various parts of the Church.

Since its beginning, the Church has been governed by leadership councils.
Priesthood councils are a fundamental order of the Church, as illustrated
repeatedly in the Doctrine and Covenants.

Sometimes these councils are advisory in nature, such as with the ward
council, where auxiliary leaders advise the bishop and Melchizedek Priesthood
leaders in the affairs of the ward.

Sometimes these councils are regulatory bodies, such as with the General
Church Coordinating Council which was announced by the First Presidency in
1977. This council consists of the First Presidency, the Council of the
Twelve, and the Presiding Bishopric. In this council, policies and procedures
are agreed upon, and the work of the Church is coordinated and correlated.

The Church Coordinating Council, after due deliberation, has approved the
establishment of councils at area and region levels throughout the Church and
multiregion councils where necessary.

These councils will make it possible to integrate better all the affairs of
the Church. Region and area leaders will be able to plan, coordinate, and
regulate _all_ the affairs of the Church at these levels in a forum that will
provide for full expression of needs, concerns, and opportunities.

These councils will also provide a better means for implementing in the field
the service functions of the temporal line established under the Presiding
Bishopric.

The leadership of a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy in area councils
and of a Regional Representative in region councils will ensure coordinated
and regulated activities at each level of Church administration. These
councils, properly organized and functioning, assure a unified approach to
move forward the ecclesiastical and temporal work of the Church for the
blessing of individuals and families.

We are confident that this expansion of priesthood councils will not only
increase efficiency and harmony, but raise the spirituality of the Church. As
Paul beautifully states in Ephesians, chapter 4, the Church organization is
given "for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the
edifying of the body of Christ:

"Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son
of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of
Christ" ([Eph.
4:12-13](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/eph/4.12-13?lang=eng#11)).

Now may I give emphasis to two subsequent verses of Paul's letter which we do
not always quote, but which have particular meaning in light of these newly
announced priesthood councils:

"But speaking the truth in love, may [we] grow up into him in all things,
which is the head, even Christ:

"From whom the whole body _fitly joined together_ and compacted by that which
_every joint supplieth,_ according to the _effectual working_ in the measure
of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in
love" ([Eph.
4:15-16](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/eph/4.15-16?lang=eng#14); italics
added).

Please note now, brothers and sisters, the whole body is compacted by that
which every _joint_ or _council_ supplies. With this action today, we are
completing the _linkage_ of the priesthood chain both ecclesiastically and
temporally. We know that you leaders will give strength to and will benefit
from participation in priesthood councils at your several levels.

May the Lord richly bless you in carrying forth this great work of
establishing Zion and preparing us for the Lord's eventual rule on earth. In
the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
