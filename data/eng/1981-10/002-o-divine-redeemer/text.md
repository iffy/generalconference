# “O, Divine Redeemer”

My brothers and sisters: I publicly express my deep gratitude to the Lord, to
our remarkable and beloved President Kimball, and to his counselors for my
call to the Twelve--among whom I shall be the least, long after being the last
so ordained.

I express deep love and appreciation to my wife, who is splendid in every way;
to my goodly and gracious parents and sisters; to my children, who are
committed to the kingdom and who have been wise enough to have married
committed eternal partners.

I realize that my life, of course, must constitute my real acceptance of the
apostolic charge. Even so, this poor tongue now seeks to speak in praise and
testimony of our Divine Redeemer.

Whether descriptively designated as Creator, Only Begotten Son, Prince of
Peace, Advocate, Mediator, Son of God, Savior, Messiah, Author and Finisher of
Salvation, King of Kings--I witness that Jesus Christ is the only name under
heaven whereby one can be saved! (See [D&amp;C 18:23](/scriptures/dc-
testament/dc/18.23?lang=eng#22).)

I testify that He is utterly incomparable in what He _is,_ what He _knows,_
what He has _accomplished,_ and what He has _experienced._ Yet, movingly, He
calls us His friends. (See [John
15:15](/scriptures/nt/john/15.15?lang=eng#14).)

We can trust, worship, and even adore Him without any reservation! As the only
Perfect Person to sojourn on this planet, there is none like Him! (See [Isa.
46:9](/scriptures/ot/isa/46.9?lang=eng#8).)

In _intelligence_ and _performance,_ He far surpasses the individual and the
composite _capacities_ and _achievements_ of all who have lived, live now, and
will yet live! (See [Abr. 3:19](/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.19?lang=eng#18).)

He rejoices in our genuine goodness and achievement, but any assessment of
where we stand in relation to Him tells us that we do not stand at all! We
kneel!

Can we, even in the depths of disease, tell Him anything at all about
suffering? In ways we cannot comprehend, our sicknesses and infirmities were
borne by Him even before these were borne by us. (See [Alma
7:11-12](/scriptures/bofm/alma/7.11-12?lang=eng#10); [Matt.
8:17](/scriptures/nt/matt/8.17?lang=eng#16).) The very weight of our combined
sins caused Him to descend below all. (See [D&amp;C 122:8](/scriptures/dc-
testament/dc/122.8?lang=eng#7).) We have never been, nor will we be, in depths
such as He has known. Thus His atonement made His empathy and His capacity to
succor us perfect, for which we can be everlastingly grateful as He tutors us
in our trials. There was no ram in the thicket at Calvary to spare Him, this
Friend of Abraham and Isaac.

Can those who yearn for hearth or home instruct Him as to what it is like to
be homeless or on the move? Did He not say in a disclosing moment that "the
foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath
not where to lay his head"? ([Matt.
8:20](/scriptures/nt/matt/8.20?lang=eng#19).)

Can we really counsel Him about being misrepresented, misunderstood, or
betrayed? Or what it is like when even friends falter or "go a fishing"? (See
[John 21:3](/scriptures/nt/john/21.3?lang=eng#2).)

Can we educate Him regarding injustice or compare failures of judicial systems
with the Giver of the Law, who, in divine dignity, endured its substantive and
procedural perversion?

And when we feel so alone, can we presume to teach Him who trod "the wine-
press alone" anything at all about feeling forsaken? ([D&amp;C
76:107](/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.107?lang=eng#106); see also [Matt.
27:46](/scriptures/nt/matt/27.46?lang=eng#45).)

Cannot the childless who crave children count on His empathy? For He loved
children and said, "Of such is the kingdom of heaven"; and "one by one, [He]
blessed them," and "he wept ... and prayed unto the Father for them. And when he
had done this he wept again." ([Matt.
19:14](/scriptures/nt/matt/19.14?lang=eng#13); [3 Ne.
17:21-22](/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/17.21-22?lang=eng#20).)

Do we presume to instruct Him in either compassion or mercy? Even at the
apogee of His agony upon the cross, He, nevertheless, consoled a thief beside
Him, saying, "To day shalt thou be with me in paradise." ([Luke
23:43](/scriptures/nt/luke/23.43?lang=eng#42).)

Can we excuse our compromises because of the powerful temptations of status
seeking? It was He who displayed incredible integrity as the adversary made
Him an offer which could not be refused--"all the kingdoms of the world, and
the glory of them." ([Matt. 4:8](/scriptures/nt/matt/4.8?lang=eng#7).) But He
refused!

Can we teach Him about enduring irony? His remaining possession, a cloak, was
gambled for even as He died. (See [Matt.
27:35](/scriptures/nt/matt/27.35?lang=eng#34).) Yet the very earth was His
footstool! Jesus gave mankind living water so that we shall never thirst
again, yet on the cross He was given vinegar! (See [John
4:10-19](/scriptures/nt/john/4.10-19?lang=eng#9); [Matt.
27:48](/scriptures/nt/matt/27.48?lang=eng#47).)

Can we lecture Him on liberty, He who sets us free from our last enemies--sin
and death?

Can those who revere human freedom yet complain about human suffering ever
achieve real reconciliation except through His gospel?

Can those concerned with nourishing the poor advise Him concerning feeding the
multitudes?

Can those who are concerned with medicine instruct Him about healing the sick?

Or can we inform the Atoner about feeling the sting of ingratitude when one's
service goes unappreciated or unnoticed? Only one leper in ten thanked Jesus,
who asked searchingly, "But where are the nine?" ([Luke
17:17](/scriptures/nt/luke/17.17?lang=eng#16).)

Should those concerned with lengthening the lifespan offer to enlighten the
Resurrector of all mankind?

Can scientists, whose discipline brings the discovery of the interweavings in
the tapestry of truth, instruct the Tapestry Maker?

Should we seek to counsel Him in courage? Should we rush forth eagerly to show
Him our mortal medals--our scratches and bruises--He who bears His five
special wounds?

Does not His "word of power" actually bring entire new worlds into being and
cause others to pass away? (See [Moses
1:35-38](/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.35-38?lang=eng#34).) Yet in the midst of such
galactic governance, He interviewed His Twelve unhurriedly "one by one" ([3
Ne. 28:1](/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/28.1?lang=eng#0)) and later called a farm boy
in rural New York.

Has He not invited us to observe His cosmic craftsmanship in the heavens that
we might see "God moving in His majesty and power"? ([D&amp;C
88:47](/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.47?lang=eng#46).) But do we not also see
Him "moving in His majesty and power" as each prodigal finally completes his
homeward orbit?

Though His creations are so vast as to be numberless even to computerized man,
has Jesus not told us that the very hairs of our head are numbered? (See
[Matt. 10:30](/scriptures/nt/matt/10.30?lang=eng#29); [Moses
1:35-38](/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.35-38?lang=eng#34).)

Did not the resurrected Jesus stand by an imprisoned Paul, telling him to be
of good cheer and calling him on his mission to Rome? (See [Acts
23:11](/scriptures/nt/acts/23.11?lang=eng#10).) Likewise, Jesus stands by the
righteous in all their individual ordeals.

Did not this good and true Shepherd forego repose after the glorious but awful
Atonement in order to establish His work among the lost sheep, disobedient in
the days of Noah? (See [1 Pet.
3:18-20](/scriptures/nt/1-pet/3.18-20?lang=eng#17).) Did He not then visit
still other lost sheep in the Americas? (See [John
10:16](/scriptures/nt/john/10.16?lang=eng#15); [3 Ne. 15:17,
21](/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/15.17,21?lang=eng#16).) Then still other lost sheep?
(See [3 Ne. 16:1-3](/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/16.1-3?lang=eng#0).) What can we
tell Him about conscientiousness?

Indeed, we cannot teach Him anything! But we can listen to Him. We can love
Him, we can honor Him, we can worship Him! We can keep His commandments, and
we can feast upon His scriptures! Yes, we who are so forgetful and even
rebellious are never forgotten by Him! We _are_ His "work" and His "glory,"
and He is _never_ distracted! (See [Moses
1:39](/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.39?lang=eng#38).)

Therefore, in addition to my boundless admiration of His achievements and my
adoration of Jesus for what He is--knowing that my superlatives are too
shallow to do more than echo his excellence--as one of His Special Witnesses
in the fulness of times, I attest to the fulness of His ministry!

How dare some treat His ministry as if it were all beatitudes and no
declaratives! How myopic it is to view His ministry as all crucifixion and no
resurrection! How provincial to perceive it as all Calvary and no Palmyra! All
rejection at a village called Capernaum and no acceptance in the City of
Enoch! All relapse and regression in ancient Israel and no Bountiful with its
ensuing decades of righteousness!

Jesus Christ is the Jehovah of the Red Sea and of Sinai, the Resurrected Lord,
the Spokesman for the Father in the theophany at Palmyra--a Palmyra pageant
with a precious audience of one!

He lives today, mercifully granting unto all nations as much light as they can
bear and messengers of their own to teach them. (See [Alma
29:8](/scriptures/bofm/alma/29.8?lang=eng#7).) And who better than the Light
of the World can decide the degree of divine disclosure--whether it is to be
flashlights or floodlights?

Soon, however, all flesh shall see Him together. All knees shall bow in His
presence, and all tongues confess His name. (See [D&amp;C
76:110-11](/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.110-11?lang=eng#109); [Philip.
2:10-11](/scriptures/nt/philip/2.10-11?lang=eng#9).) Knees which never before
have assumed _that_ posture for _that_ purpose will do so then--and promptly.
Tongues which have never before spoken His name except in gross profanity will
do so then--and worshipfully.

Soon, He who was once mockingly dressed in purple will come again, attired in
red apparel, reminding us whose blood redeemed us. (See [D&amp;C
133:48-49](/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/133.48-49?lang=eng#47).)

All will then acknowledge the completeness of His justice and His mercy (see
[Alma 12:15](/scriptures/bofm/alma/12.15?lang=eng#14)) and will see how human
indifference to God--not God's indifference to humanity--accounts for so much
suffering.

Then we will see the true story of mankind--and not through glass darkly. (See
[1 Cor. 13:12](/scriptures/nt/1-cor/13.12?lang=eng#11).) The great military
battles will appear as mere bonfires which blazed briefly, and the mortal
accounts of the human experience will be but graffiti on the walls of time.

Before that reckoning moment, however, both your ministry and mine will unfold
in the grim but also glorious circumstances of the last days.

Yes, there will be wrenching polarization on this planet, but also the
remarkable reunion with our colleagues in Christ from the City of Enoch. Yes,
nation after nation will become a house divided, but more and more unifying
Houses of the Lord will grace this planet. Yes, Armageddon lies ahead. But so
does Adam-ondi-Ahman!

Meanwhile, did not Jesus tell us what to expect by way of heat in the final
summer? Did He not also say that He would prove our faith and patience by
trial?

Did He not provide needed proportion when He spoke of the comparative few who
will find the narrow way leading to the strait gate? (See [Matt.
7:13-14](/scriptures/nt/matt/7.13-14?lang=eng#12).) Did He not also say that
His Saints, scattered upon all the face of the earth, would, in the midst of
wickedness, commotion, and persecution, be "armed with righteousness and with
the power of God," for He is determined to have "a pure people"? ([1 Ne.
14:12-14](/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/14.12-14?lang=eng#11); [D&amp;C
100:16](/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/100.16?lang=eng#15).)

His work proceeds forward almost as if in the comparative calmness of the eye
of a storm. First, He reigns in the midst of His saints; soon, in all the
world! (See [D&amp;C 1:36](/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.36?lang=eng#35);
[D&amp;C 133:2-3](/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/133.2-3?lang=eng#1).)

So as the shutters of human history begin to close as if before a gathering
storm, and as events scurry across the human scene like so many leaves before
a wild wind--those who stand before the warm glow of the gospel fire can be
permitted a shiver of the soul. Yet in our circle of certitude, we know, even
in the midst of all these things, that there will be no final frustration of
God's purposes. God has known "all things from the beginning; wherefore he
prepareth a way to accomplish all his works among the children of men." ([1
Ne. 9:6](/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/9.6?lang=eng#5).)

Humbly, therefore, I promise to go whithersoever I am sent, striving to speak
the words He would have me say and acknowledging in the tremblings of my soul
that I cannot fully be His Special Witness unless my life is fully special. I
close with pleadings from the hymn "O, Divine Redeemer!" which pleadings are
my pleadings:

_Ah! turn me not away,_

_Receive me, tho' unworthy, ... _

_Hear Thou my cry, ... _

_Behold, Lord, my distress! ... _

_Thy pity show in my deep anguish! ... _

_Shield me in danger,_

_O regard me! ... _

_O, divine Redeemer! ... _

_Grant me pardon, and remember not, remember not, O Lord, my sins! ... _

_Help me, my Savior!_

In the holy name of Jesus Christ, amen.
