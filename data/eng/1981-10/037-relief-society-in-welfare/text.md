# Relief Society in Welfare

The roots of Relief Society in welfare lie at its very founding, for it was at
the first meeting that the Prophet Joseph Smith admonished the sisters to
_search_ after objects of charity and _minister_ to their wants.

How well they accepted the charge is reflected in a report of the Nauvoo
"Necessity Committee" on August 5, 1843:

"Sister Jones, Sister Mecham and myself have visited our ward--went to every
house, _found_ many sick. ... _Found_ Sister Miller, an old lady, sick without
bed or bedding, no changes of clothing. _Found_ Sister Broomley very sick,
nothing at all to eat." (Amy Brown Lyman, comp., Minutes of the General Board
of Relief Society, 1842-1892, p. 72.)

The sisters rose one by one and offered the needed donations. Sister Woolley
would give "one yard of fine muslin, a flannel petticoat ... , 60 cents ... ,
Sister German, "a suit of clothes [for] old [Sister] Miller." (Ibid.)

A young Nauvoo widow with several children, Sister Ellen Douglas, gives a
glimpse of the early Relief Society ministrations in a letter dated April 14,
1844, to her parents in England:

"I was taken very ill. ... Sometimes I thot I should die and then I thot of my
poor children. I prayed for their sakes that I might live. I didn't pray
alone, but many of my brothers and sisters prayed likewise and our prayers
were answered." (Kate B. Carter, comp., _Our Pioneer Heritage,_ Salt Lake
City: Daughters of Utah Pioneers, 1960, 3:159.)

After Sister Douglas began to recover, she visited a friend who suggested she
"make application to the female Relief Society for some clothing which I
needed for myself and family. ... I [reluctantly] agreed and we went to one of
the sisters [of the Society]. ... I told her ... while I was sick my children wore
out their clothes because I could not mend them, so she said she would do the
best she could for me. ... In a few days ... they brought a wagon and fetched me
such a present as I never received before from no place in the world." (Ibid.)

In the Salt Lake Valley, the sisters continued their ministrations--sometimes
in dramatic ways--as Sister Lucy Meserve Smith, wife of Elder George A. Smith,
recalls in her Reminiscences. News of the approach of a handcart company came
to President Brigham Young as he was conducting October conference in the old
Tabernacle. She stated:

"President Young and others were [so] excited and anxious for fear those
companies would be caught in the snows in the mountains [that] they could not
go on with the Conference. The president called for men, teams, clothing and
provisions. ... The sisters stripped off their petticoats, stockings, and every
thing they could spare, right there ... and piled [them] into the wagons to send
to the Saints in the mountains." (Reminiscences of Lucy Meserve Smith, MS,
1886, Historical Department, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,
Salt Lake City.)

Other conditions and other times in the history of the Church created other
challenges and responses and _new_ frontiers for Relief Society in welfare
work. _Today is such a time._

The poor are still with us. There are refugees, the homeless. There is an ever
increasing number of the aged. There are those without work, the sick, the
bereaved, the poor in spirit, those with personal problems and burdens that
press upon them. Even in our urban society, more and more suffer from feelings
of isolation. There is no social ill that hasn't in some way affected us,
bringing the need for succor and prevention.

So, what is, or what shall be, Relief Society's response as an organization?
as leaders? as individual members of Relief Society?

Though the problems of our day are enormous, we have excellent resources with
which to solve them. In addition to the million and one-half women members--
Relief Society's greatest asset--the organization itself is one of the most
important Church welfare resources. _First,_ because its chief purposes have
always been welfare-related. _Second,_ because in its curriculum, welfare
principles are taught, and sisters are provided a laboratory experience that
trains them in personal and family preparedness, in parenting, and in
homemaking. _Third,_ because the organization is a structure through which the
prescribed welfare program of the Church is carried out. _Fourth,_ because it
is a fast, effective means of providing women volunteers for welfare.

To illustrate, after the collapse of the South Vietnamese government, many
refugees were sent in 1975 to the United States.

"As the first group came into the Presidio Army Base in San Francisco, Relief
Society sisters in that area were called during the night to come to the base
[to] help wash, feed, and put clean clothes on the children. The Relief
Society sisters began arriving at 4:00 A.M. and worked all day, giving
immunization shots." (_Relief Society Courses of Study 1979-80,_ Salt Lake
City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1978, p. 42.) These
sisters treated infections, comforting and ministering to the homeless
children.

As an organization, Relief Society provides a network through which _every_
woman can be quickly reached in times of disaster. In the Teton Dam disaster
of 1976, calls for needed volunteer help went from nearby stake Relief Society
presidents to ward presidents, to visiting teaching supervisors, to visiting
teachers, to sisters who responded willingly. Thus, in a very short time, the
needed help was recruited.

Another important resource for dealing with welfare problems is informed,
compassionate Relief Society leaders.

When a Relief Society president and her counselors attend welfare services
committee meetings and contribute meaningfully to discussions, when they
observe welfare needs of members and bring that information to the agendas of
welfare meetings, when they help implement the action of welfare committees,
they _are_ carrying out the welfare objectives of the Society. A ward Relief
Society president making a family-needs visit at the direction of the bishop
_is_ ministering to the needy. A president training visiting teachers to
search out the poor and needy _is_ following the Prophet's instruction.

Too often, needs go undiscovered because they are not readily observed. Ward
Relief Society presidents, therefore, should instruct visiting teachers on how
to recognize signs of depression, of loneliness, and of physical want.

One pair of sensitive visiting teachers visited the young family of a recently
graduated dental student. The family had, through self-sacrifice and stringent
budgeting, endured the hard years of schooling required of the husband. As the
sisters visited the mother the noticed that the soles of the shoes of the
young children playing on the floor were completely worn through and would
give scant protection to their little feet. This was confidentially reported
to the Relief Society president, and the parents were persuaded to accept a
little help until the young father could begin earning.

Of all the ways Relief Society furthers the welfare cause, its best effort
comes as it helps _individual_ sisters anticipate and meet their _own_ needs,
for welfare problems are most effectively solved before they _become_
problems. Therefore, when you, the individual member, put into daily practice
the principles of welfare, you are _personally_ reducing the woe of the world.
When you add to your home storage, particularly with goods you have produced
by your hands, in your garden, with your needle, or in your kitchen, you are
addressing welfare needs in the most effective way. When preventive health
care, good nutrition, and financial management are practiced by you, the
individual sister, the welfare system _is_ working. When you teach your
children how to work--when you, as members, and your children become educated
and engage in appropriate employment and careers--future problems are averted.

The emotional support and strength that you Relief Society sisters can provide
one another can be as important, or more so, than food or shelter. The husband
of a sister recently lost his job. In relating the experience, she said the
family was financially somewhat prepared, in that they had food storage and
some money saved. But they were _not_ prepared for the emotional shock of
unemployment. The wife recalled that the single greatest help the family
received to lessen the trauma of that experience was the love and sympathetic
concern shown by the sisters of Relief Society.

In a Spiritual Living lesson a few years ago (1979-80, p. 42), we were told,
"Fear that we haven't enough energy, money, or other means can keep us from
giving love." We may think, "We can't feed all the hungry, lodge all the
homeless, nor comfort all who grieve ... ; therefore, [we] will help no one."
(Ibid.) But Alma has told us that "by small and simple things are great things
brought to pass." ([Alma
37:6](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/37.6?lang=eng#5).)

One dollar given for a welfare assessment or a fast offering, one day of
volunteer service, a visit (even without the loaf of bread), multiplied by a
million and one-half members, can relieve much suffering.

Thus, though frontiers of welfare needs stretch before us different in scope
from those of 1842, but similar too, the challenge for Relief Society today
remains as then: to _search_ out the poor, to _minister_ to their wants, to
_prevent_ problems by learning, teaching, and practicing the principles of
welfare. The Lord spoke plainly when he told Joseph Smith:

"And remember in all things the poor and the needy, the sick and the
afflicted, for he that doeth not these things, the same is not my disciple."
([D&amp;C 52:40](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-
testament/dc/52.40?lang=eng#39).)

I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
