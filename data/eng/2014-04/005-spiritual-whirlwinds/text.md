# Spiritual Whirlwinds

I greet you this morning--especially the young people who are both here in the
Conference Center and throughout the world. Yours is a chosen generation of
destiny, and I speak especially to you.

Many years ago while we were visiting our family in Florida, a tornado touched
down not too far from us. One woman living in a mobile home went into her
bathroom for safety. The mobile home began to shake. A few moments passed.
Then she heard her neighbor's voice: "I am here in the front room." Coming out
of the bathroom, to her great astonishment, she discovered that the tornado
had lifted and carried her mobile home through the air, landing it perfectly
upright on the top of her neighbor's mobile home.

My young friends, the world will not glide calmly toward the Second Coming of
the Savior. The scriptures declare that "all things shall be in commotion."[1]
Brigham Young said, "It was revealed to me in the commencement of this Church,
that the Church would spread, prosper, grow and extend, and that in proportion
to the spread of the Gospel among the nations of the earth, so would the power
of Satan rise."[2]

More concerning than the prophesied earthquakes and wars[3] are the spiritual
whirlwinds that can uproot you from your spiritual foundations and land your
spirit in places you never imagined possible, sometimes with your barely
noticing that you have been moved.

The worst whirlwinds are the temptations of the adversary. Sin has always been
part of the world, but it has never been so accessible, insatiable, and
acceptable. There is, of course, a powerful force that will subdue the
whirlwinds of sin. It is called repentance.

Not all the whirlwinds in life are of your own making. Some come because of
the wrong choices of others, and some come just because this is mortality.

As a young boy, President Boyd K. Packer suffered from the crippling disease
of polio. When Elder Dallin H. Oaks was seven years old, his father died
suddenly. When Sister Carol F. McConkie of the Young Women general presidency
was a teenager, her parents divorced. Challenges will come to you, but as you
trust in God, they will strengthen your faith.

In nature, trees that grow up in a windy environment become stronger. As winds
whip around a young sapling, forces inside the tree do two things. First, they
stimulate the roots to grow faster and spread farther. Second, the forces in
the tree start creating cell structures that actually make the trunk and
branches thicker and more flexible to the pressure of the wind. These stronger
roots and branches protect the tree from winds that are sure to return.[4]

You are infinitely more precious to God than a tree. You are His son or His
daughter. He made your spirit strong and capable of being resilient to the
whirlwinds of life. The whirlwinds in your youth, like the wind against a
young tree, can increase your spiritual strength, preparing you for the years
ahead.

How do you prepare for your whirlwinds? "Remember ... it is upon the rock of our
Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation;
that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, ... his shafts in the
whirlwind, ... when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it
shall have no power ... to drag you down ... because of the rock upon which ye are
built."[5] This is your safety in the whirlwind.

President Thomas S. Monson has said, "Where once the standards of the Church
and the standards of society were mostly compatible, now there is a wide chasm
between us, and it's growing ever wider."[6] This chasm, for some, stirs
strong spiritual whirlwinds. Let me share an example.

This past month the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve published a
letter to leaders of the Church across the world. In part it read: "Changes in
the civil law do not, indeed cannot, change the moral law that God has
established. God expects us to uphold and keep His commandments regardless of
divergent opinions or trends in society. His law of chastity is clear: sexual
relations are proper only between a man and a woman who are legally and
lawfully wedded as husband and wife. We urge you to review ... the doctrine
contained in 'The Family: A Proclamation to the World.'"[7]

As the world slips away from the Lord's law of chastity, we do not. President
Monson said: "The Savior of mankind described Himself as being in the world
but not of the world. We also can be in the world but not of the world as we
reject false concepts and false teachings and remain true to that which God
has commanded."[8]

While many governments and well-meaning individuals have redefined marriage,
the Lord has not. In the very beginning, God initiated marriage between a man
and a woman--Adam and Eve. He designated the purposes of marriage to go far
beyond the personal satisfaction and fulfillment of adults to, more
importantly, advancing the ideal setting for children to be born, reared, and
nurtured. Families are the treasure of heaven.[9]

Why do we continue to talk about this? As Paul said, "We look not at the
things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen."[10] As Apostles
of the Lord Jesus Christ, we have the responsibility to teach our Creator's
plan for His children and to warn of the consequences of disregarding His
commandments.

Recently, I spoke with a Laurel from the United States. I quote from her
email:

"This past year some of my friends on Facebook began posting their position on
marriage. Many favored same-sex marriage, and several LDS youth indicated they
'liked' the postings. I made no comment.

"I decided to declare my belief in traditional marriage in a thoughtful way.

"With my profile picture, I added the caption 'I believe in marriage between a
man and a woman.' Almost instantly I started receiving messages. 'You are
selfish.' 'You are judgmental.' One compared me to a slave owner. And I
received this post from a great friend who is a strong member of the Church:
'You need to catch up with the times. Things are changing and so should you.'

"I did not fight back," she said, "but I did not take my statement down."

She concludes: "Sometimes, as President Monson said, 'You have to stand
alone.' Hopefully as youth, we will stand together in being true to God and to
the teachings of His living prophets."[11]

Of special concern to us should be those who struggle with same-sex
attraction. It is a whirlwind of enormous velocity. I want to express my love
and admiration for those who courageously confront this trial of faith and
stay true to the commandments of God![12] But everyone, independent of his or
her decisions and beliefs, deserves our kindness and consideration.[13]

The Savior taught us to love not only our friends but also those who disagree
with us--and even those who repudiate us. He said: "For if ye love them which
love you, what reward have ye? ... And if ye salute your brethren only, what do
ye more than others?"[14]

The Prophet Joseph Smith warned us to "beware of self-righteousness" and to
enlarge our hearts toward all men and women until we feel "to take them upon
our shoulders."[15] In the gospel of Jesus Christ, there is no place for
ridicule, bullying, or bigotry.

If you have a question about counsel from the leaders of the Church, please
discuss your honest concerns with your parents and leaders. You need the
strength that comes from trusting the Lord's prophets. President Harold B. Lee
said: "The only safety we have as members of this church is to ... learn to give
heed to the words and commandments that the Lord shall give through His
prophet. ... There will be some things that take patience and faith. You may not
like what comes. ... It may contradict your political views ... your social views
... interfere with ... your social life. But if you listen to these things, as if
from the mouth of the Lord Himself, ... 'the gates of hell shall not prevail
against you ... and the Lord God will disperse the powers of darkness from
before you ...' ([D&amp;C 21:6](/scriptures/dc-
testament/dc/21.6?lang=eng#5))."[16]

Another powerful protection from the whirlwinds of life is the Book of Mormon.

When President Henry B. Eyring was a teenager, his family moved to a new city.
He initially found the move unpleasant and made few friends. He felt like he
didn't fit in with the students in his high school. The whirlwinds were
swirling. What did he do? He threw his energy into the Book of Mormon, reading
it many times.[17] Years later, President Eyring testified: "I [love to] go
back to the Book of Mormon and drink deeply and often."[18] "[It] is the most
powerful written testimony we have that Jesus is the Christ."[19]

The Lord has given you another way to stand firm, a spiritual gift more
powerful than the whirlwinds of the adversary! He said, "Stand ... in holy
places, and be not moved."[20]

When I was a teenager, there were only 13 temples in the Church. Now there are
142. Eighty-five percent of Church members live within 200 miles (320 km) of a
temple. The Lord has given your generation greater access to His holy temples
than any other generation in the history of the world.

Have you ever stood in the temple, dressed in white, waiting to do baptisms?
How did you feel? There is a tangible feeling of holiness in the temple. The
peace of the Savior subdues the swirling whirlwinds of the world.

The way you feel in the temple is a pattern for how you want to feel in your
life.[21]

Find your grandfathers and grandmothers and your distant cousins who have gone
before you. Take their names to the temple with you.[22] As you learn about
your ancestors, you will see patterns of life, of marriage, of children;
patterns of righteousness; and occasionally patterns that you will want to
avoid.[23]

Later in the temple you will learn more about the Creation of the world, about
the patterns in the lives of Adam and Eve, and most importantly, about our
Savior, Jesus Christ.

My young brothers and sisters, how we love you, admire you, and pray for you.
Don't let the whirlwinds drag you down. These are your days--to stand strong
as disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ.[24]

Build more firmly your foundation upon the rock of your Redeemer.

Treasure more completely His incomparable life and teachings.

Follow more diligently His example and His commandments.

Embrace more deeply His love, His mercy and grace, and the powerful gifts of
His Atonement.

As you do, I promise you that you will see the whirlwinds for what they are--
tests, temptations, distractions, or challenges to help you grow. And as you
live righteously year after year, I assure you that your experiences will
confirm to you again and again that Jesus is the Christ. The spiritual rock
under your feet will be solid and secure. You will rejoice that God has placed
you here to be a part of the final preparations for Christ's glorious return.

The Savior said, "I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you."[25]
This is His promise to you. I know this promise is real. I know that He lives,
in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

If a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege; ... but if he did not believe in him there was no law to punish him" ([Alma 30:7, 9](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/30.7,9?lang=eng#6)).
