# Being Temperate in All Things

In response to the Prophet Joseph Smith's inquiry, the Lord instructed: "And
no one can assist in this work except he shall be humble and full of love,
having faith, hope, and charity, being temperate in all things, whatsoever
shall be entrusted to his care."[1]

The instruction on being temperate in all things applies to each of us. What
is temperance, and why would the Lord want us to be temperate? A narrow
definition might be "exercising restraint when it comes to food and drink."
Indeed, this meaning of temperance could be a good prescription for keeping
the Word of Wisdom. Sometimes _temperance_ might be defined as "refraining
from anger or not losing one's temper." These definitions, however, are a
subset of the scriptural usage of the word.

In a spiritual sense, temperance is a divine attribute of Jesus Christ. He
desires for each of us to develop this attribute. Learning to be temperate in
all things is a spiritual gift available through the Holy Ghost.

When the Apostle Paul described certain fruits of the Spirit in his Epistle to
the Galatians, he talked of "love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness,
goodness, faith, meekness, [and] temperance."[2]

When Paul wrote Titus, describing the attributes necessary for a bishop to
assist in this work, he said a bishop must "not [be] selfwilled, not soon
angry, ... [but] temperate."[3] Being temperate is to use moderation in all
things or to exercise self-control.

When Alma the Younger taught in the land of Gideon, he said:

"I trust that ye are not lifted up in the pride of your hearts; yea, I trust
that ye have not set your hearts upon riches and the vain things of the world.
...

"I would that ye should be humble, and be submissive and gentle; easy to be
entreated; full of patience and long-suffering; being temperate in all
things."[4]

In a later message, Alma instructed his son Shiblon, and by extension
instructs all of us, to "see that ye are not lifted up unto pride."[5] Rather,
we should "be diligent and temperate in all things."[6] Being temperate means
to carefully examine our expectations and desires, to be diligent and patient
in seeking righteous goals.

A few years ago, I was driving home from work when a large semitruck,
traveling in the opposite direction, lost one of its dual tires. The tire flew
over the median separating our lanes. It came bouncing down my side of the
freeway. Cars were swerving in both directions, drivers not knowing which
direction the tire would bounce next. I dodged left when I should have dodged
right, and the tire took its final bounce right on the corner of my
windshield.

A friend called my wife to inform her of the accident. She told me later that
her first thought was of lacerations from shattered glass. Indeed, I was
covered with beads of broken glass but did not suffer a single scratch. It was
definitely not because of my driving skills; rather, it was because the
windshield of my little car was made of tempered glass.

Tempered glass, like tempered steel, undergoes a well-controlled heating
process which increases strength. Thus, when tempered glass is under stress,
it will not easily break into jagged shards that can injure.

Likewise, a temperate soul--one who is humble and full of love--is also a
person of increased spiritual strength. With increased spiritual strength, we
are able to develop self-mastery and to live with moderation. We learn to
control, or temper, our anger, vanity, and pride. With increased spiritual
strength, we can protect ourselves from the dangerous excesses and destructive
addictions of today's world.

We all seek peace of mind, and we all desire security and happiness for our
families. If we look for silver linings in this past year's economic downturn,
perhaps the trials some have faced have taught us that peace of mind,
security, and happiness do not come from buying a home or accumulating
possessions for which the debt incurred is larger than our savings or income
can afford.

We live in an impatient and intemperate world full of uncertainty and
contention. It is like the community of converts to various religions where
Joseph Smith lived when he was a 14-year-old boy seeking answers to his
questions. Young Joseph said, "All their good feelings one for another, if
they ever had any, were entirely lost in a strife of words and a contest about
opinions."[7]

Security for our families comes from learning self-control, avoiding the
excesses of this world, and being temperate in all things. Peace of mind comes
from strengthened faith in Jesus Christ. Happiness comes from being diligent
in keeping covenants made at baptism and in the holy temples of the Lord.

What better example do we have of temperance than our Savior, Jesus Christ?

When our hearts are stirred to anger by disputation and contention, the Savior
taught that we should "repent, and become as a little child."[8] We should be
reconciled with our brother and come to the Savior with full purpose of
heart.[9]

When others are unkind, Jesus taught that "my kindness shall not depart from
thee."[10]

When we are confronted with affliction, He said: "Be patient in afflictions,
revile not against those that revile. Govern your house in meekness, and be
steadfast."[11]

When we are oppressed, we can be comforted in knowing "he was oppressed, and
he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth."[12] "Surely he has borne our
griefs, and carried our sorrows."[13]

When Jesus Christ, the greatest of all, suffered for us to the extent that He
bled from every pore, He did not express anger or revile in suffering. With
unsurpassed self-restraint, or temperance, His thoughts were not of Himself
but of you and of me. And then, in humility and full of love, He said,
"Nevertheless, glory be to the Father, and I partook and finished my
preparations unto the children of men."[14]

During this past year, it has been my privilege to bear testimony of the
reality of our Savior and the Restoration of the gospel to Saints and friends
throughout Asia. Most are first-generation Latter-day Saints who live on the
frontier of the Church. This latter-day journey in their realm is reminiscent
of that experienced by the first Latter-day Saints of yesteryear.

In this marvelous world of diversity in Asia, where members of The Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are a mere fraction of one percent of the
vast population, I have gained a better appreciation for the Christlike
attribute of temperance. I love and honor these Saints, who have taught me by
example what it means to be humble and full of love, "being temperate in all
things, whatsoever shall be entrusted to [their] care."[15] Through them I
have come to better understand God's love for all of His children.

I leave my witness that our Redeemer lives and His divine gift of temperance
is available to each of God's children, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
