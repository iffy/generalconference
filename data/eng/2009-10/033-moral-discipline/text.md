# Moral Discipline

During World War II, President James E. Faust, then a young enlisted man in
the United States Army, applied for officer candidate school. He appeared
before a board of inquiry composed of what he described as "hard-bitten career
soldier[s]." After a while their questions turned to matters of religion. The
final questions were these:

"In times of war should not the moral code be relaxed? Does not the stress of
battle justify men in doing things that they would not do when at home under
normal situations?"

President Faust relates:

"I recognized that here was a chance perhaps to make some points and look
broad-minded. I knew perfectly well that the men who were asking me this
question did not live by the standards that I had been taught. The thought
flashed through my mind that perhaps I could say that I had my own beliefs but
did not wish to impose them on others. But there seemed to flash before my
mind the faces of the many people to whom I had taught the law of chastity as
a missionary. In the end I simply said, 'I do not believe there is a double
standard of morality.'

"I left the hearing resigned to the fact that [they] would not like the
answers I had given ... and would surely score me very low. A few days later
when the scores were posted, to my astonishment I had passed. I was in the
first group taken for officer's candidate school! ...

"This was one of the critical crossroads of my life."[1]

President Faust recognized that we all possess the God-given gift of moral
agency--the right to make choices and the obligation to account for those
choices (see [D&amp;C 101:78](/scriptures/dc-
testament/dc/101.78?lang=eng#77)). He also understood and demonstrated that,
for positive outcomes, moral agency must be accompanied by moral discipline.

By "moral discipline," I mean self-discipline based on moral standards. Moral
discipline is the consistent exercise of agency to choose the right because it
is right, even when it is hard. It rejects the self-absorbed life in favor of
developing character worthy of respect and true greatness through Christlike
service (see [Mark 10:42-45](/scriptures/nt/mark/10.42-45?lang=eng#41)). The
root of the word _discipline_ is shared by the word _disciple,_ suggesting to
the mind the fact that conformity to the example and teachings of Jesus Christ
is the ideal discipline that, coupled with His grace, forms a virtuous and
morally excellent person.

Jesus's own moral discipline was rooted in His discipleship to the Father. To
His disciples He explained, "My meat is to do the will of him that sent me,
and to finish his work" ([John 4:34](/scriptures/nt/john/4.34?lang=eng#33)).
By this same pattern, our moral discipline is rooted in loyalty and devotion
to the Father and the Son. It is the gospel of Jesus Christ that provides the
moral certainty upon which moral discipline rests.

The societies in which many of us live have for more than a generation failed
to foster moral discipline. They have taught that truth is relative and that
everyone decides for himself or herself what is right. Concepts such as sin
and wrong have been condemned as "value judgments." As the Lord describes it,
"Every man walketh in his own way, and after the image of his own god"
([D&amp;C 1:16](/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.16?lang=eng#15)).

As a consequence, self-discipline has eroded and societies are left to try to
maintain order and civility by compulsion. The lack of internal control by
individuals breeds external control by governments. One columnist observed
that "gentlemanly behavior [for example, once] protected women from coarse
behavior. Today, we expect sexual harassment laws to restrain coarse behavior.
...

"Policemen and laws can never replace customs, traditions and moral values as
a means for regulating human behavior. At best, the police and criminal
justice system are the last desperate line of defense for a civilized society.
Our increased reliance on laws to regulate behavior is a measure of how
uncivilized we've become."[2]

In most of the world, we have been experiencing an extended and devastating
economic recession. It was brought on by multiple causes, but one of the major
causes was widespread dishonest and unethical conduct, particularly in the
U.S. housing and financial markets. Reactions have focused on enacting more
and stronger regulation. Perhaps that may dissuade some from unprincipled
conduct, but others will simply get more creative in their circumvention.[3]
There could never be enough rules so finely crafted as to anticipate and cover
every situation, and even if there were, enforcement would be impossibly
expensive and burdensome. This approach leads to diminished freedom for
everyone. In the memorable phrase of Bishop Fulton J. Sheen, "We would not
accept the yoke of Christ; so now we must tremble at the yoke of Caesar."[4]

In the end, it is only an internal moral compass in each individual that can
effectively deal with the root causes as well as the symptoms of societal
decay. Societies will struggle in vain to establish the common good until sin
is denounced as sin and moral discipline takes its place in the pantheon of
civic virtues.[5]

Moral discipline is learned at home. While we cannot control what others may
or may not do, the Latter-day Saints can certainly stand with those who
demonstrate virtue in their own lives and inculcate virtue in the rising
generation. Remember from Book of Mormon history the young men who were key to
the Nephite victory in the long war of 66 to 60 B.C.--the sons of the people
of Ammon. Their character and discipline were described in these words:

"They were men who were true at all times in whatsoever thing they were
entrusted.

"Yea, they were men of truth and soberness, for they had been taught to keep
the commandments of God and to walk uprightly before him" ([Alma
53:20-21](/scriptures/bofm/alma/53.20-21?lang=eng#19)).

"Now they never had fought, yet they did not fear death; and they did think
more upon the liberty of their fathers than they did upon their lives; yea,
they had been taught by their mothers, that if they did not doubt, God would
deliver them" ([Alma 56:47](/scriptures/bofm/alma/56.47?lang=eng#46)).

"Now this was the faith of these of whom I have spoken; they are young, and
their minds are firm, and they do put their trust in God continually" ([Alma
57:27](/scriptures/bofm/alma/57.27?lang=eng#26)).

Here we find a standard for what should happen in our homes and in the Church.
Our teaching should draw upon our own faith and focus first and foremost on
instilling faith in God in the rising generation. We must declare the
essential need to keep the commandments of God and to walk uprightly before
Him in soberness, or in other words, with reverence. Each must be persuaded
that service and sacrifice for the well-being and happiness of others are far
superior to making one's own comfort and possessions the highest priority.

This requires more than an occasional reference to one or another gospel
principle. There must be _constant_ teaching, mostly by example. President
Henry B. Eyring expressed the vision we strive to attain:

"The pure gospel of Jesus Christ must go down into the hearts of [our
children] by the power of the Holy Ghost. It will not be enough for them to
have had a spiritual witness of the truth and to want good things later. It
will not be enough for them to hope for some future cleansing and
strengthening. Our aim must be for them to become truly converted to the
restored gospel of Jesus Christ while they are with us. ...

"Then they will have gained a strength from what they are, not only from what
they know. They will become disciples of Christ."[6]

I have heard a few parents state that they don't want to impose the gospel on
their children but want them to make up their own minds about what they will
believe and follow. They think that in this way they are allowing children to
exercise their agency. What they forget is that the intelligent use of agency
requires knowledge of the truth, of things as they really are (see [D&amp;C
93:24](/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.24?lang=eng#23)). Without that, young
people can hardly be expected to understand and evaluate the alternatives that
come before them. Parents should consider how the adversary approaches their
children. He and his followers are not promoting objectivity but are vigorous,
multimedia advocates of sin and selfishness.

Seeking to be neutral about the gospel is, in reality, to reject the existence
of God and His authority. We must, rather, acknowledge Him and His omniscience
if we want our children to see life's choices clearly and be able to think for
themselves. They should not have to learn by sad experience that "wickedness
never was happiness" ([Alma 41:10](/scriptures/bofm/alma/41.10?lang=eng#9)).

I can share with you a simple example from my own life of what parents can do.
When I was about five or six years old, I lived across the street from a small
grocery store. One day two other boys invited me to go with them to the store.
As we stood coveting the candy for sale there, the older boy grabbed a candy
bar and slipped it into his pocket. He urged the other boy and me to do the
same, and after some hesitation we did. Then we quickly left the store and ran
off in separate directions. I found a hiding place at home and tore off the
candy wrapper. My mother discovered me with the chocolate evidence smeared on
my face and escorted me back to the grocery store. As we crossed the street, I
was sure I was facing life imprisonment. With sobs and tears, I apologized to
the owner and paid him for the candy bar with a dime that my mother had loaned
me (which I had to earn later). My mother's love and discipline put an abrupt
and early end to my life of crime.

All of us experience temptations. So did the Savior, but He "gave no heed unto
them" ([D&amp;C 20:22](/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.22?lang=eng#21)).
Similarly, we do not have to yield simply because a temptation surfaces. We
may want to, but we don't have to. An incredulous female friend asked a young
adult woman, committed to living the law of chastity, how it was possible that
she had never "slept with anybody." "Don't you _want_ to?" the friend asked.
The young woman thought: "The question intrigued me, because it was so utterly
beside the point. ... Mere wanting is hardly a proper guide for moral
conduct."[7]

In some cases, temptation may have the added force of potential or actual
addiction. I am grateful that for an increasing number of people the Church
can provide therapeutic help of various kinds to aid them in avoiding or
coping with addictions. Even so, while therapy can support a person's will, it
cannot substitute for it. Always and ever, there must be an exercise of
discipline--moral discipline founded on faith in God the Father and the Son
and what They can achieve with us through the atoning grace of Jesus Christ.
In Peter's words, "The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of
temptations" ([2 Peter 2:9](/scriptures/nt/2-pet/2.9?lang=eng#8)).

We cannot presume that the future will resemble the past--that things and
patterns we have relied upon economically, politically, socially will remain
as they have been. Perhaps our moral discipline, if we will cultivate it, will
have an influence for good and inspire others to pursue the same course. We
may thereby have an impact on future trends and events. At a minimum, moral
discipline will be of immense help to us as we deal with whatever stresses and
challenges may come in a disintegrating society.

We have heard thoughtful and inspired messages during this conference, and in
a moment President Thomas S. Monson will provide concluding words of counsel.
As we prayerfully consider what we have learned and relearned, I believe that
the Spirit will shed further light on those things that have particular
application for each of us individually. We will be fortified in the moral
discipline needed to walk uprightly before the Lord and be at one with Him and
the Father.

I stand with my brethren and with you, my brothers and sisters, as a witness
that God is our Father and that His Son, Jesus, is our Redeemer. Their law is
immutable, Their truth is everlasting, and Their love is infinite. In the name
of Jesus Christ, amen.

What conduct is actually legal is, in many instances, way below the standards of a civilized society and light years below the teachings of the Christ.
