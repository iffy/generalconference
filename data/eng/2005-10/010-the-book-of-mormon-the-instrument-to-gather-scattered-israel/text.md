# The Book of Mormon, the Instrument to Gather Scattered Israel

Thirty-six years ago I served a mission in southeast Mexico. At that time
there were no stakes, with the largest cities in the mission having only two
branches. There were limited opportunities for education and much poverty.
With two or three exceptions, all the missionaries were from the United
States.

I remember the people of the Nealtican Branch. All buildings in the town were
made of adobe, except the Catholic cathedral and the LDS chapel. I remember
standing in the small adobe house of the branch president. It had a dirt
floor, windows with no glass, and a rug hanging over the entryway. There was
no furniture in the house. His family had no shoes.

But they were a happy people. He told me that they had sold everything they
had to buy bus tickets to the Mesa temple, where they were sealed for time and
all eternity. Many of the branch members had done the same thing.

A month ago I returned to Mexico to serve in the Mexico North Area Presidency.
The Mexico of today is much different from that of 36 years ago. Nealtican is
the center of a thriving stake of Zion. Mexico has 200 stakes and a million
members of the Church. Many stake and ward leaders are highly educated and
financially secure. Thousands of young men and women from Mexico are serving
full-time missions.

Truly the vision seen by Lehi and interpreted by Nephi is coming to pass. "And
at that day shall the remnant of _our seed_ know that they are of the _house
of Israel,_ and that _they_ are the _covenant_ people of the Lord; and then
shall they _know_ and come to the knowledge of their _forefathers,_ and also
to the knowledge of the _gospel_ of their Redeemer, which was ministered unto
their _fathers by him;_ wherefore, they shall come to the knowledge of their
_Redeemer._"[1]

Truly the people of Mexico and other Latin American countries are among the
descendants of prophets. The Book of Mormon is their inheritance. Jesus Christ
did minister unto their fathers.

After His Resurrection, Jesus Christ descended out of heaven, clothed in a
white robe, and stood in the midst of their ancestors here in the Americas. He
stretched forth His hand and said: "Behold, I am Jesus Christ, whom the
prophets testified shall come into the world.

"... I am the light and the life of the world."[2]

"Therefore, hold up your light that it may shine unto the world. Behold I am
the light which ye shall hold up."[3]

To the Church in our day, the Savior repeated that counsel when He said,
"Verily I say unto you all: Arise and shine forth, that thy light may be a
standard for the nations."[4] Jesus Christ is the light that we hold up as a
standard to all nations. We offer the additional light of Jesus Christ as
revealed in the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ.

President Hinckley has challenged us to read or reread the Book of Mormon
before year-end, in commemoration of the 200th anniversary of the birth of the
Prophet Joseph Smith. By so doing, we honor Joseph Smith, who translated the
Book of Mormon "by the gift and power of God."[5]

When the ancient prophet Moroni appeared to Joseph, he told him "that God had
a work for [him] to do; and that [his] name should be had for good and evil
among all nations, kindreds, and tongues, or that it should be both good and
evil spoken of among all people."[6]

That prophecy has come to pass. The name of Joseph Smith is known and revered
throughout the world, even in the remote village of Nealtican, Mexico.

Recently, a member in Monterrey, Mexico, told me how the Book of Mormon
changed his life. As a teenager, Jesus Santos was impressed by the LDS
missionaries he saw walking down the dusty streets. He wanted to talk to them
about their church but was told by a friend that you have to wait for them to
contact you.

Many times he would go to the Church building and look through the iron fence
at the missionaries and the Mutual youth playing games. They seemed to be so
wholesome, and he wanted to be part of them. He would lean his chin on the
fence, hoping that they would notice him and invite him to participate with
them. It never happened.

As Jesus recounted his story to me, he said, "It is sad. I was a young man and
could have served a full-time mission."

He moved to Monterrey, Mexico. _Nine_ years later he was visiting a friend
across town when the missionaries knocked at the door. His friend wanted to
send them away. Jesus begged him to let the missionaries talk to them for just
two minutes. His friend consented.

The missionaries talked about the Book of Mormon, how Lehi's family traveled
from Jerusalem to the Americas, and how the resurrected Jesus Christ visited
Lehi's descendants in America.

Jesus wanted to know more. He was especially intrigued by the picture
depicting Christ's appearance in America. He gave the missionaries his
address. He waited for months, but they never made contact with him.

_Three_ more years passed. Some friends invited his family to a family home
evening. They gave him a copy of the Book of Mormon.

As soon as he began to read it, he knew the Book of Mormon was true. Finally,
12 years after he first became aware of the Church, he and his wife were
baptized. So many years had been lost. If missionaries had just talked to him,
if the Mutual youth had just noticed a lonely teenager looking over the fence,
if the missionaries in Monterrey had found him at home, his life would have
been different during those 12 years. Gratefully, member neighbors invited him
for a family home evening and shared with him that book which has such great
converting power, the Book of Mormon.

Today Jesus Santos serves as the president of the Monterrey Mexico Temple.

Jesus Christ gave us the Book of Mormon as the instrument to gather scattered
Israel. At the time of His appearance in America, He told the people, "And
when these things come to pass that thy _seed_ shall begin to _know_ these
things--it shall be a _sign_ unto them, that they may _know_ that the work of
the Father hath already commenced unto the fulfilling of the _covenant_ which
he hath made unto the people who are of the _house of Israel._"[7]

The Book of Mormon is _its own witness_ to the people of Latin America and of
all nations. Its very coming forth in these latter days bears witness that God
has once again begun to _gather scattered Israel._

In my mind's eye, I can still see Jesus Santos as a ragged 18-year-old boy
looking over the fence at the chapel. Can you see him? Can you invite him and
others like him to be one with us? Whom do you know that would respond to your
invitation to read the Book of Mormon? Will you invite them? Don't wait.

I testify that Joseph Smith is the prophet of the Restoration. The Book of
Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ is the means whereby people from all
nations shall be gathered into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints. This Church is founded upon apostles and prophets, just as it was in
ancient days. President Gordon B. Hinckley is the Lord's anointed prophet on
the earth today. Jesus Christ is our Savior and our Redeemer. This is His
Church and His kingdom. He is our King Immanuel. I so testify in the name of
Jesus Christ, amen.
