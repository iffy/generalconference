# Church Auditing Department Report, 2014

Dear Brethren: As directed by revelation in section 120 of the Doctrine and
Covenants, the Council on the Disposition of the Tithes--composed of the First
Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and the Presiding Bishopric--
authorizes the expenditure of Church funds. Church entities disburse funds in
accordance with approved budgets, policies, and procedures.

The Church Auditing Department, which consists of credentialed professionals
and is independent of all other Church departments, has responsibility to
perform audits for the purpose of providing reasonable assurance regarding
contributions received, expenditures made, and safeguarding of Church assets.

Based upon audits performed, the Church Auditing Department is of the opinion
that, in all material respects, contributions received, expenditures made, and
assets of the Church for the year 2014 have been recorded and administered in
accordance with approved Church budgets, policies, and accounting practices.
The Church follows the practices taught to its members of living within a
budget, avoiding debt, and saving against a time of need.

Respectfully submitted,

Church Auditing Department

Kevin R. Jergensen

Managing Director
