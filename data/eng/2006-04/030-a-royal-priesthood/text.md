# A Royal Priesthood

My dear brethren, it is always a great privilege and heavy responsibility to
address the priesthood of the Church. Possibly this is the largest gathering
of priesthood in the history of the world. I should like to speak to you young
men about how blessed you are to hold the Aaronic Priesthood, which is also
known as the "lesser priesthood." But the word _lesser,_ however, does not in
any way take away from its importance. There's nothing small about it--
especially when I see how big some of you young men are!

I'm sure you remember how excited you were the first time you passed the
sacrament. As you Aaronic Priesthood holders assist in preparing, blessing,
administering, and passing the sacrament, you help all members who partake
thereof to recommit themselves to the Lord and to renew their faith in the
Savior's atoning sacrifice. Members who take the sacrament are reminded to
take upon themselves the name of the Son, always remember Him, keep His
commandments, and seek to have His Spirit to be with them. I hope that you
will value the priesthood you hold and always honor your priesthood duties.

I recently read the account of some deacons who got a little careless in their
attitude towards passing the sacrament. They began to think of it as a chore,
something that no one else wanted to do. They often came in late, and
sometimes they didn't dress appropriately. One Sunday their priesthood adviser
told them: "You don't have to worry about the sacrament today. It's been taken
care of."

They were, of course, surprised to hear this, but as usual, they were late for
sacrament meeting. They slipped in casually during the opening hymn and sat in
the congregation. That's when they noticed who was sitting on the deacons'
bench--their adviser and the high priests of the ward, who included men who
had served as bishops and stake president. They were all dressed in dark suits
with white shirts and ties. But more than that, their bearing was one of total
reverence as they took the sacrament trays from row to row. Something was
deeper and more significant about the sacrament that day. Those deacons who
had become so perfunctory in their duties learned by example that passing the
sacrament was a sacred trust and one of the greatest of honors.[1] They began
to realize that the priesthood is, as the Apostle Peter called it, "a royal
priesthood."[2]

Generally, the Aaronic Priesthood, under the direction of the bishopric, has
the responsibility to administer and pass the sacrament. In our home ward here
in Salt Lake City, we have a good number of faithful, older members but few of
Aaronic Priesthood age. Over the years I have watched these high priests and
elders, men of faith and great accomplishments, humbly and reverently pass the
sacrament of the Lord's Supper. For a while this group of priesthood holders
included a senior federal judge, a candidate for the office of governor of the
state of Utah, and other prominent men of stature. Yet they were honored and
obviously felt privileged to perform this sacred priesthood duty.

The Aaronic Priesthood is a great gift of spiritual power that the Lord
conferred upon Aaron and his sons.[3] It holds "the key of the ministering of
angels and the preparatory gospel"[4] and also includes "the gospel of
repentance, and of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins."[5]

I would like to say a word about the ministering of angels. In ancient and
modern times angels have appeared and given instruction, warnings, and
direction, which benefited the people they visited. We do not consciously
realize the extent to which ministering angels affect our lives. President
Joseph F. Smith said, "In like manner our fathers and mothers, brothers,
sisters and friends who have passed away from this earth, having been
faithful, and worthy to enjoy these rights and privileges, may have a mission
given them to visit their relatives and friends upon the earth again, bringing
from the divine Presence messages of love, of warning, or reproof and
instruction, to those whom they had learned to love in the flesh."[6] Many of
us feel that we have had this experience. Their ministry has been and is an
important part of the gospel. Angels ministered to Joseph Smith as he
reestablished the gospel in its fulness.

Alma the Younger had a personal experience with ministering angels. As a young
man, he was numbered among the unbelievers and "led many of the people to do
after the manner of his iniquities." One day, "while he was going about to
destroy the church of God" in company with the sons of Mosiah, an "angel of
the Lord appeared unto them; and he descended as it were in a cloud; and he
spake as it were with a voice of thunder, which caused the earth to shake."
The angel then cried out, "Alma, arise and stand forth, for why persecutest
thou the church of God?"

Alma was so overcome by this experience that he fainted and had to be carried
to his father. Only after his father and others had fasted and prayed for two
days was Alma restored to full health and strength. He then stood up and
declared, "I have repented of my sins, and have been redeemed of the Lord;
behold I am born of the Spirit."[7] Alma went on to become one of the greatest
missionaries in the Book of Mormon. Yet in all his many years of missionary
service, he never spoke of the angel's visit. Instead, he chose to testify
that the truth had been made known to him by the Holy Spirit of God.

To be instructed by an angel would be a great blessing. However, as Alma
taught us, his final and lasting conversion came only after he had "fasted and
prayed many days."[8] His complete conversion came from the Holy Ghost, which
is available to all of us if we are worthy.

Miraculous events have not always been a source of conversion. For example,
when Laman and Lemuel physically mistreated their younger brothers, an angel
appeared and warned them to stop. The angel also reassured all of the brothers
that Laban would be delivered into their hands. Nephi, on the one hand,
believed and claimed the brass plates from Laban. Laman and Lemuel, on the
other hand, did not believe, nor did they change their behavior as a result of
the angelic visit. As Nephi reminded them, "How is it that ye have forgotten
that ye have seen an angel of the Lord?"[9]

You young men are building your testimonies. These are strengthened by
spiritual confirmation through the Holy Ghost in the ordinary experiences of
life. While some great manifestation could strengthen your testimony, it won't
likely happen that way.

While holding the priesthood brings great blessings, the priesthood also
carries with it great obligations.

  1. All priesthood holders need to magnify their callings, acting in the Lord's name to the extent their office and calling permit. We magnify our callings by following the direction of our quorum presidency, the bishop, and our quorum adviser. It means preparing, administering, and passing the sacrament as we are asked to do so. It also means performing other responsibilities of the Aaronic Priesthood, such as cleaning our Church meetinghouses, setting up chairs for stake conference and other Church meetings, and performing other duties as assigned.

  2. Holders of the Aaronic, or preparatory, Priesthood are obligated to qualify for the higher priesthood and to receive training for greater responsibilities in Church service.

  3. Holding the Aaronic Priesthood carries with it the obligation of being a good example, with clean thoughts and proper behavior. We acquire these attributes as we carry out our priesthood duties.

  4. You will be associated in your quorum and other activities with young men who have the same standards that you have. You can strengthen each other.

  5. You can study the scriptures and learn gospel principles to help you prepare for a mission.

  6. You can learn to pray and recognize answers.

The Doctrine and Covenants describes different kinds of authority relating to
the Aaronic Priesthood. First, ordination to the priesthood gives authority to
perform the ordinances and possess the power of the Aaronic Priesthood. The
bishopric is the presidency of the Aaronic Priesthood in the ward.[10] Second,
within this priesthood are different offices, each with different
responsibilities and privileges. As a deacon, you are to watch over the Church
as a standing minister.[11] As a teacher, in addition to watching over the
Church, you are to "be with and strengthen them."[12] As a priest, you are "to
preach, teach, expound, exhort, and baptize, and administer the sacrament, and
visit the house of each member."[13] Your bishop, who holds the office of high
priest, is also the president of the priests quorum and directs the work of
the quorum.

As you progress from one of these offices of the Aaronic Priesthood to the
next, you will retain the authority of the previous one. For example, those of
you who are priests still have authority to do everything you did as deacons
and teachers. Indeed, even when you are ultimately ordained to the Melchizedek
Priesthood, you will still keep and act in the offices of the Aaronic
Priesthood. The late Elder LeGrand Richards, who was a member of the Quorum of
the Twelve for many years, understood this principle well. He often used to
say, "I'm just a grown-up deacon."

As I have noted, teaching is one of the important duties of the Aaronic
Priesthood. The opportunity for you young teenagers to teach often comes as
you serve as a home teaching companion to your father or some other
Melchizedek Priesthood holder. Looking after needs in a temporal and spiritual
way is a very significant part of watching over the Church.

The Prophet Joseph Smith gave high priority to home teaching. A Brother Oakley
was the Prophet's home teacher, and whenever Brother Oakley went home teaching
to the Smith home, "the Prophet called his family together and gave his own
chair to Oakley, telling his family" to listen carefully to Brother
Oakley.[14]

You young men of the Aaronic Priesthood need to have the Spirit with you in
your personal lives as well as in home teaching, preparing or passing the
sacrament, or other priesthood activities. You will need to avoid some
stumbling blocks. One of the biggest of these is addiction.

I counsel all of you brethren to avoid every kind of addiction. At this time
Satan and his followers are enslaving some of our choicest young people
through addiction to alcohol, all kinds of drugs, pornography, tobacco,
gambling, and other compulsive disorders. Some people seem to be born with a
weakness for these substances so that only a single experimentation will
result in uncontrollable addiction. Some addictions are actually mind-altering
and create a craving that overpowers reason and judgment. These addictions
destroy the lives not only of those who do not resist them but also their
parents, spouses, and children. As the prophet Jeremiah lamented, "The kings
of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world, would not have believed
that the adversary and the enemy should have entered into the gates."[15]

The Lord in His wisdom has warned us that substances that are not good for us
should be totally avoided. We have been warned not to take the first drink,
smoke the first cigarette, or try the first drug. Curiosity and peer pressure
are selfish reasons to dabble with addictive substances. We should stop and
consider the full consequences, not just to ourselves and our futures, but
also to our loved ones. These consequences are physical, but they also risk
the loss of the Spirit and cause us to fall prey to Satan.

I testify of the refining, spiritual, comforting, strengthening, and
restraining influence the priesthood has had in my life. I have lived under
its spiritual influence all my life--in my grandfather's home, in my father's
home, and then in my own home. It is humbling to use the transcending power
and authority of the priesthood to empower others and to heal and bless. May
we live worthy of holding the priesthood authority to act in the name of God,
I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
