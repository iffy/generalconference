# Broken Things to Mend

The first words Jesus spoke in His majestic Sermon on the Mount were to the
troubled, the discouraged and downhearted. "Blessed are the poor in spirit,"
He said, "for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."[1] Whether you are members of
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or among the tens of thousands
listening this morning who are not of our faith, I speak to those who are
facing personal trials and family struggles, those who endure conflicts fought
in the lonely foxholes of the heart, those trying to hold back floodwaters of
despair that sometimes wash over us like a tsunami of the soul. I wish to
speak particularly to you who feel your lives are broken, seemingly beyond
repair.

To all such I offer the surest and sweetest remedy that I know. It is found in
the clarion call the Savior of the world Himself gave. He said it in the
beginning of His ministry, and He said it in the end. He said it to believers,
and He said it to those who were not so sure. He said to everyone, whatever
their personal problems might be:

"Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you
rest.

"Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and
ye shall find rest unto your souls."[2]

In this promise, that introductory phrase, "come unto me," is crucial. It is
the key to the peace and rest we seek. Indeed, when the resurrected Savior
gave His sermon at the temple to the Nephites in the New World, He began,
"Blessed are the poor in spirit who _come unto me,_ for theirs is the kingdom
of heaven."[3]

When Andrew and John first heard Christ speak, they were so moved they
followed Him as He walked away from the crowd. Sensing He was being pursued,
Jesus turned and asked the two men, "What seek ye?" They answered, "Where
dwellest thou?" And Christ said, "Come and see." The next day He found another
disciple, Philip, and said to him, "Follow me."[4] Just a short time later He
formally called Peter and others of the new Apostles with the same spirit of
invitation. Come, "follow me,"[5] He said.

It seems clear that the essence of our duty and the fundamental requirement of
our mortal life is captured in these brief phrases from any number of scenes
in the Savior's mortal ministry. He is saying to us, "Trust me, learn of me,
do what I do. Then, when you walk where _I_ am going," He says, "we can talk
about where _you_ are going, and the problems you face and the troubles you
have. If you will follow me, I will lead you out of darkness," He promises. "I
will give you answers to your prayers. I will give you rest to your souls."

My beloved friends, I know of no other way for us to succeed or to be safe
amid life's many pitfalls and problems. I know of no other way for us to carry
our burdens or find what Jacob in the Book of Mormon called "that happiness
which is prepared for the saints."[6]

So how does one "come unto Christ" in response to this constant invitation?
The scriptures give scores of examples and avenues. You are well acquainted
with the most basic ones. The easiest and the earliest comes simply with the
desire of our heart, the most basic form of faith that we know. "If ye can no
more than _desire_ to believe," Alma says, exercising just "a _particle_ of
faith," giving even a _small place_ for the promises of God to find a home--
that is enough to begin.[7] Just believing, just having a "molecule" of faith
--simply hoping for things which are not yet seen in our lives, but which are
nevertheless truly there to be bestowed[8]--that simple step, when focused on
the Lord Jesus Christ, has ever been and always will be the first principle of
His eternal gospel, the first step out of despair.

Second, we must change anything we can change that may be part of the problem.
In short we must repent, perhaps the most hopeful and encouraging word in the
Christian vocabulary. We thank our Father in Heaven we are _allowed_ to
change, we thank Jesus we _can_ change, and ultimately we do so only with
Their divine assistance. Certainly not everything we struggle with is a result
of our actions. Often it is the result of the actions of others or just the
mortal events of life. But anything _we_ can change we _should_ change, and we
must forgive the rest. In this way our access to the Savior's Atonement
becomes as unimpeded as we, with our imperfections, can make it. He will take
it from there.

Third, in as many ways as possible we try to take upon us His identity, and we
begin by taking upon us His name. That name is formally bestowed by covenant
in the saving ordinances of the gospel. These start with baptism and conclude
with temple covenants, with many others, such as partaking of the sacrament,
laced throughout our lives as additional blessings and reminders. Teaching the
people of his day the message we give this morning, Nephi said: "Follow the
Son, with full purpose of heart, ... with real intent, ... take upon you the name
of Christ. ... Do the things which I have told you I have seen that your Lord
and your Redeemer [will] do."[9]

Following these most basic teachings, a splendor of connections to Christ
opens up to us in multitudinous ways: prayer and fasting and meditation upon
His purposes, savoring the scriptures, giving service to others, "succor[ing]
the weak, lift[ing] up the hands which hang down, ... strengthen[ing] the feeble
knees."[10] Above all else, loving with "the pure love of Christ," that gift
that "never faileth," that gift that "beareth all things, believeth all
things, hopeth all things, [and] endureth all things."[11] Soon, with that
kind of love, we realize our days hold scores of thoroughfares leading to the
Master and that every time we reach out, however feebly, for Him, we discover
He has been anxiously trying to reach us. So we step, we strive, we seek, and
we never yield.[12]

My desire today is for _all_ of us--not just those who are "poor in spirit"
but _all_ of us--to have more straightforward personal experience with the
Savior's example. Sometimes we seek heaven too obliquely, focusing on programs
or history or the experience of others. Those are important but not as
important as personal experience, true discipleship, and the strength that
comes from experiencing firsthand the majesty of His touch.

Are you battling a demon of addiction--tobacco or drugs or gambling, or the
pernicious contemporary plague of pornography? Is your marriage in trouble or
your child in danger? Are you confused with gender identity or searching for
self-esteem? Do you--or someone you love--face disease or depression or death?
Whatever other steps you may need to take to resolve these concerns, come
_first_ to the gospel of Jesus Christ. Trust in heaven's promises. In that
regard Alma's testimony is my testimony: "I do know," he says, "that whosoever
shall put their trust in God shall be supported in their trials, and their
troubles, and their afflictions."[13]

This reliance upon the merciful nature of God is at the very center of the
gospel Christ taught. I testify that the Savior's Atonement lifts from us not
only the burden of our sins but also the burden of our disappointments and
sorrows, our heartaches and our despair.[14] From the beginning, trust in such
help was to give us both a reason and a way to improve, an incentive to lay
down our burdens and take up our salvation. There can and will be plenty of
difficulties in life. Nevertheless, the soul that comes unto Christ, who knows
His voice and strives to do as He did, finds a strength, as the hymn says,
"beyond [his] own."[15] The Savior reminds us that He has "graven [us] upon
the palms of [His] hands."[16] Considering the incomprehensible cost of the
Crucifixion and Atonement, I promise you He is not going to turn His back on
us now. When He says to the poor in spirit, "Come unto me," He means He knows
the way out and He knows the way up. He knows it because He has walked it. He
knows the way because He _is_ the way.

Brothers and sisters, whatever your distress, _please_ don't give up and
_please_ don't yield to fear. I have always been touched that as his son was
departing for his mission to England, Brother Bryant S. Hinckley gave young
Gordon a farewell embrace and then slipped him a handwritten note with just
five words taken from the fifth chapter of Mark: "Be not afraid, only
believe."[17] I think also of that night when Christ rushed to the aid of His
frightened disciples, walking as He did on the water to get to them, calling
out, "It is I; be not afraid." Peter exclaimed, "Lord, if it be thou, bid me
come unto thee on the water." Christ's answer to him was as it _always_ is
_every_ time: "_Come,_" He said. Instantly, as was his nature, Peter sprang
over the vessel's side and into the troubled waters. While his eyes were fixed
upon the Lord, the wind could toss his hair and the spray could drench his
robes, but all was well--he was coming to Christ. It was only when his faith
wavered and fear took control, only when he removed his glance from the Master
to look at the furious waves and the ominous black gulf beneath, only then did
he begin to sink into the sea. In newer terror he cried out, "Lord, save me."

Undoubtedly with some sadness, the Master over every problem and fear, He who
is the solution to every discouragement and disappointment, stretched out His
hand and grasped the drowning disciple with the gentle rebuke, "O thou of
little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?"[18]

If you are lonely, please know you can find comfort. If you are discouraged,
please know you can find hope. If you are poor in spirit, please know you can
be strengthened. If you feel you are broken, please know you can be mended.

_In Nazareth, the narrow road,_

_That tires the feet and steals the breath,_

_Passes the place where once abode_

_The Carpenter of Nazareth._

_And up and down the dusty way_

_The village folk would often wend;_

_And on the bench, beside Him, lay_

_Their broken things for Him to mend._

_The maiden with the doll she broke,_

_The woman with the broken chair,_

_The man with broken plough, or yoke,_

_Said, "Can you mend it, Carpenter?"_

_And each received the thing he sought,_

_In yoke, or plough, or chair, or doll;_

_The broken thing which each had brought_

_Returned again a perfect whole._

_So, up the hill the long years through,_

_With heavy step and wistful eye,_

_The burdened souls their way pursue,_

_Uttering each the plaintive cry:_

_"O Carpenter of Nazareth,_

_This heart, that's broken past repair,_

_This life, that's shattered nigh to death,_

_Oh, can You mend them, Carpenter?"_

_And by His kind and ready hand,_

_His own sweet life is woven through_

_Our broken lives, until they stand_

_A New Creation--"all things new."_

_"The shattered [substance] of [the] heart,_

_Desire, ambition, hope, and faith,_

_Mould Thou into the perfect part,_

_O, Carpenter of Nazareth!"_[19]

May we all, especially the poor in spirit, come unto Him and be made whole, I
pray, in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, amen.
