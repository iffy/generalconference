# Nurturing Marriage

My beloved brethren and sisters, thank you for your love of the Lord and His
gospel. Wherever you live, your righteous lives provide good examples in these
days of decaying morals and disintegrating marriages.

As we Brethren travel about the world, sometimes we see worrisome scenes. On a
recent flight, I sat behind a husband and wife. She obviously loved her
husband. As she stroked the back of his neck I could see her wedding ring. She
would nestle close to him and rest her head upon his shoulder, seeking his
companionship.

In contrast, he seemed totally oblivious to her presence. He was focused
solely upon an electronic game player. During the entire flight, his attention
was riveted upon that device. Not once did he look at her, speak to her, or
acknowledge her yearning for affection.

His inattention made me feel like shouting: "Open your eyes, man! Can't you
see? Pay attention! Your wife loves you! She needs you!"

I don't know more about them. I haven't seen them since. Perhaps I was alarmed
unduly. And very possibly, if this man knew of my concern for them, he might
feel sorry for me in not knowing how to use such an exciting toy.

But these things I do know: I know "that marriage between a man and a woman is
ordained of God and that the family is central to the Creator's plan for the
eternal destiny of His children."[1] I know that the earth was created and
that the Lord's Church was restored so that families could be sealed and
exalted as eternal entities.[2] And I know that one of Satan's cunning methods
of undermining the work of the Lord is to attack the sacred institutions of
marriage and the family.

Marriage brings greater possibilities for happiness than does any other human
relationship. Yet some married couples fall short of their full potential.
They let their romance become rusty, take each other for granted, allow other
interests or clouds of neglect to obscure the vision of what their marriage
really could be. Marriages would be happier if nurtured more carefully.

I realize that many mature members of the Church are not married. Through no
failing of their own, they deal with the trials of life alone. Be we all
reminded that in the Lord's own way and time, no blessings will be withheld
from His faithful Saints.[3] For those who are now or will be married, I
suggest two steps you can take to have a more joyful marriage.

## I. Doctrinal Foundation

The first step is to comprehend the doctrinal foundation for marriage. The
Lord declared that marriage is the legal wedding of one man and one woman:
"Marriage is ordained of God unto man.

"Wherefore, it is lawful that he should have one wife, and they twain shall be
one flesh, and all this that the earth might answer the end of its
creation."[4]

Worldly trends to define marriage in some other way would sadly serve to
destroy the institution of marriage. Such schemes are contrary to the plan of
God.

It was He who said: "For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and
shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh."[5]

Scripture further reaffirms that "the man [is not] without the woman, neither
the woman without the man, in the Lord."[6]

Marriage is the foundry for social order, the fountain of virtue, and the
foundation for eternal exaltation. Marriage has been divinely designated as an
eternal and everlasting covenant.[7] Marriage is sanctified when it is
cherished and honored in holiness. That union is not merely between husband
and wife; it embraces a partnership with God.[8] "Husband and wife have a
solemn responsibility to love and care for each other."[9] Children born of
that marital union are "an heritage of the Lord."[10] Marriage is but the
beginning bud of family life; parenthood is its flower. And that bouquet
becomes even more beautiful when graced with grandchildren. Families may
become as eternal as the kingdom of God itself.[11]

Marriage is both a commandment and an exalting principle of the gospel.[12]
Because it is ordained of God, the intimate physical expressions of married
love are sacred. Yet all too commonly, these divine gifts are desecrated. If a
couple allows lewd language or pornography to corrupt their intimacy, they
offend their Creator while they degrade and diminish their own divine gifts.
True happiness is predicated upon personal purity.[13] Scripture commands: "Be
ye clean."[14] Marriage should ever be a covenant to lift husbands and wives
to exaltation in celestial glory.

Marriage was intended by the Lord to endure beyond physical death. His plan
offers eternal perpetuation of the family in the kingdom of God. His plan
provides temples and opportunities to officiate therein for the living and the
dead. A marriage sealed there launches a husband and wife into that grand
order of unity so necessary to the perfection of God's work.[15]

Doctrines related to marriage include individual agency and accountability.
All of us are accountable for our choices. Couples blessed with children are
accountable to God for the care they give to their children.

As I meet with priesthood leaders, I often ask about the priorities of their
various responsibilities. Usually they mention their important Church duties
to which they have been called. Too few remember their responsibilities at
home. Yet priesthood offices, keys, callings, and quorums are meant to exalt
families.[16] Priesthood authority has been restored so that families can be
sealed eternally. So brethren, your foremost priesthood duty is to nurture
your marriage--to care for, respect, honor, and love your wife. Be a blessing
to her and your children.

## II. Strengthening Marriage

With these doctrinal underpinnings in mind, let us consider the second step--
specific actions that would strengthen a marriage. I will offer sample
suggestions and invite each couple privately to ponder them and adapt them as
needed to their own particular circumstances.

My suggestions use three action verbs: to_ appreciate, _to_ communicate,_ and
to_ contemplate._

To _appreciate_--to say "I love you" and "thank you"--is not difficult. But
these expressions of love and appreciation do more than acknowledge a kind
thought or deed. They are signs of sweet civility. As grateful partners look
for the good in each other and sincerely pay compliments to one another, wives
and husbands will strive to become the persons described in those compliments.

Suggestion number two--to _communicate_ well with your spouse--is also
important. Good communication includes taking time to plan together. Couples
need private time to observe, to talk, and really listen to each other. They
need to cooperate--helping each other as equal partners. They need to nurture
their spiritual as well as physical intimacy. They should strive to elevate
and motivate each other. Marital unity is sustained when goals are mutually
understood. Good communication is also enhanced by prayer. To pray with
specific mention of a spouse's good deed (or need) nurtures a marriage.

My third suggestion is to _contemplate._ This word has deep meaning. It comes
from Latin roots: _con,_ meaning "with," and _templum,_ meaning "a space or
place to meditate." It is the root from which the word _temple_ comes. If
couples contemplate often--with each other in the temple--sacred covenants
will be better remembered and kept. Frequent participation in temple service
and regular family scripture study nourish a marriage and strengthen faith
within a family. Contemplation allows one to anticipate and to resonate (or be
in tune) with each other and with the Lord. Contemplation will nurture both a
marriage and God's kingdom. The Master said, "Seek not the things of this
world but seek ye first to build up the kingdom of God, and to establish his
righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you."[17]

I invite each marital partner to consider these suggestions and then determine
specific goals to nurture your own relationship. Begin with sincere desire.
Identify those actions needed to bless your spiritual unity and purpose. Above
all, do not be selfish! Generate a spirit of selflessness and generosity.
Celebrate and commemorate each day together as a treasured gift from heaven.

President Harold B. Lee said "that the most important of the Lord's work you
and I will ever do will be within the walls of our own homes."[18] And
President David O. McKay declared, "No other success can compensate for
failure in the home."[19]

When you as husband and wife recognize the divine design in your union--when
you feel deeply that God has brought you to each other--your vision will be
expanded and your understanding enhanced. Such feelings are expressed in words
of a song that has long been a favorite of mine:

_Because you come to me with naught save love,_

_And hold my hand and lift mine eyes above,_

_A wider world of hope and joy I see,_

_Because you come to me._

_Because you speak to me in accents sweet,_

_I find the roses waking round my feet,_

_And I am led through tears and joy to thee,_

_Because you speak to me._

_Because God made thee mine, I'll cherish thee_

_Through light and darkness, through all time to be,_

_And pray His love may make our love divine,_

_Because God made thee mine._[20]

That each marriage may be so nurtured is my prayer, in the name of Jesus
Christ, amen.
