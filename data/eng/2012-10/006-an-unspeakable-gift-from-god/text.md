# An Unspeakable Gift from God

In 1994, President Howard W. Hunter invited all members of the Church to
"establish the temple ... as the great symbol of [our] membership."[1] Later
that same year, construction on the Bountiful Utah Temple was completed. Like
many, we were anxious to take our young family to the open house prior to the
dedication. We labored diligently to prepare our children to enter the temple,
praying earnestly that they would have a spiritual experience so that the
temple would become a focal point in their lives.

As we reverently walked through the temple, I found myself admiring the
magnificent architecture, the elegant finishes, the light shining through
towering windows, and many of the inspiring paintings. Every aspect of this
sacred building was truly exquisite.

Stepping into the celestial room, I suddenly realized that our youngest son,
six-year-old Ben, was clinging to my leg. He appeared anxious--perhaps even a
little troubled.

"What's wrong, Son?" I whispered.

"Daddy," he replied, "what's happening here? I've never felt this way before."

Recognizing that this was likely the first time our young son had felt the
influence of the Holy Ghost in such a powerful way, I knelt down on the floor
next to him. While other visitors stepped around us, Ben and I spent several
minutes, side by side, learning about the Holy Ghost together. I was amazed at
the ease with which we were able to discuss his sacred feelings. As we talked,
it became clear that what was most inspiring to Ben was not what he _saw_ but
what he _felt_--not the physical beauty around us but the still, small voice
of the Spirit of God within his heart. I shared with him what I had learned
from my own experiences, even as his childlike wonder reawakened in me a deep
sense of gratitude for this unspeakable gift from God--the gift of the Holy
Ghost.[2]

## Who Is the Holy Ghost?

The Holy Ghost is the third member of the Godhead, and, as such, like God the
Father and Jesus Christ, He knows our thoughts and the intents of our
hearts.[3] The Holy Ghost loves us and wants us to be happy. Since He knows
the challenges we will face, He can guide us and teach us all things we must
do to return and live with our Heavenly Father once again.[4]

Unlike Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, who have glorified bodies of flesh
and bones, the Holy Ghost is a personage of spirit who communicates to our
spirits through feelings and impressions.[5] As a spirit being, He has the
unique responsibility of being an agent through which personal revelation is
received. In scripture, the Holy Ghost is often referred to as the Holy
Spirit, the Spirit of the Lord, the Holy Spirit of Promise, or simply the
Spirit.[6]

## What Is the Mission of the Holy Ghost?

The Holy Ghost works in perfect unity with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ,
fulfilling many important roles and distinct responsibilities. The primary
purpose of the Holy Ghost is to bear witness of God the Father and of His Son,
Jesus Christ,[7] and to teach us the truth of all things.[8] A sure witness
from the Holy Ghost carries far more certainty than a witness from any other
source. President Joseph Fielding Smith taught that "the Spirit of God
speaking to the spirit of man has power to impart truth with greater effect
and understanding than the truth can be imparted by personal contact even with
heavenly beings."[9]

The Holy Ghost is also known as the Comforter.[10] During times of trouble or
despair or simply when we need to know that God is near, the Holy Ghost can
lift our spirits, give us hope, and teach us "the peaceable things of the
kingdom,"[11] helping us feel "the peace of God, which passeth all
understanding."[12]

Several years ago as our extended family gathered for a holiday dinner, my
father began playing games with many of his grandchildren. Suddenly and
without warning, he collapsed and quickly passed away. This unexpected event
could have been devastating, especially for his grandchildren, raising
questions that are difficult to answer. However, as we gathered our children
around us, as we prayed and read the words of Book of Mormon prophets about
the purpose of life, the Holy Ghost comforted each of us personally. In ways
that are difficult to describe with words, the answers we sought came clearly
into our hearts. We felt a peace that day that truly surpassed _our_
understanding, yet the witness from the Holy Ghost was certain, undeniable,
and true.

The Holy Ghost is a teacher and a revelator.[13] As we study, ponder, and pray
about gospel truths, the Holy Ghost enlightens our minds and quickens our
understanding.[14] He causes the truth to be indelibly written in our souls
and can cause a mighty change to occur in our hearts. As we share these truths
with our families, with fellow members of the Church, and with friends and
neighbors in our community, the Holy Ghost becomes their teacher as well, for
He carries the message of the gospel "unto the hearts of the children of
men."[15]

The Holy Ghost inspires us to reach out to others in service. For me, the most
vivid examples of heeding the promptings of the Holy Ghost in the service of
others come from the life and ministry of President Thomas S. Monson, who
said: "In the performance of our responsibilities, I have learned that when we
heed a silent prompting and act upon it without delay, our Heavenly Father
will guide our footsteps and bless our lives and the lives of others. I know
of no experience more sweet or feeling more precious than to heed a prompting
only to discover that the Lord has answered another person's prayer through
you."[16]

I share just one tender experience. While President Monson was serving as a
bishop, he learned that a member of his ward, Mary Watson, was in the
hospital. As he went to visit her, he learned that she was staying in a large
room with several other patients. When he approached Sister Watson, he noticed
that the patient in a neighboring bed quickly covered her head.

After President Monson had visited with Sister Watson and given her a
priesthood blessing, he shook her hand, said good-bye, and prepared to leave.
Then a simple but amazing thing happened. I quote now from President Monson's
own recollection of this experience:

"I could not leave her side. It was as though an unseen hand [was] resting on
my shoulder, and I felt within my soul that I was hearing these words: 'Go
over to the next bed where the little lady covered her face when you came in.'
I did so. ...

"I approached the bedside of the other patient, gently tapped her shoulder and
carefully pulled back the sheet which had covered her face. Lo and behold!
She, too, was a member of my ward. I had not known she was a patient in the
hospital. Her name was Kathleen McKee. When her eyes met mine, she exclaimed
through her tears, 'Oh, Bishop, when you entered that door, I felt you had
come to see me and bless me in response to my prayers. I was rejoicing inside
to think that you would know I was here, but when you stopped at the other
bed, my heart sank, and I knew that you had not come to see me.'

"I said to [Sister] McKee: 'It does not matter that I didn't know you were
here. It is important, however, that our Heavenly Father knew and that you had
prayed silently for a priesthood blessing. It was He who prompted me to
intrude on your privacy.'"[17]

## How Does the Holy Ghost Speak to Us?

We all have experiences with the Holy Ghost, even though we may not always
recognize them. As inspired thoughts come into our minds, we know them to be
true by the spiritual feelings that enter into our hearts. President Boyd K.
Packer has taught: "The Holy Ghost speaks with a voice that you _feel_ more
than you _hear._ ... While we speak of 'listening' to the whisperings of the
Spirit, most often one describes a spiritual prompting by saying, 'I had a
_feeling_ ...'"[18] It is through these sacred feelings from the Holy Ghost that
we come to know what God would have us do, for this, as stated in scripture,
"is the spirit of revelation."[19]

## What Does It Mean to Receive the Gift of the Holy Ghost?

In teaching our six-year-old son, Ben, I thought it important to differentiate
between what he was feeling, which was the influence of the Holy Ghost, and
the gift of the Holy Ghost, which he would receive after baptism. Before
baptism, all honest and sincere seekers of truth can feel the influence of the
Holy Ghost from time to time. However, the opportunity to receive the constant
companionship of the Holy Ghost and the _fulness_ of all the associated
blessings is available only to worthy, baptized members who receive the gift
of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands through those holding the
priesthood authority of God.

Through the gift of the Holy Ghost, we receive added capacity and spiritual
gifts, increased revelation and protection, steady guidance and direction, and
the promised blessings of sanctification and exaltation in the celestial
kingdom. All of these blessings are given as a result of our personal desire
to receive them and come as we align our lives with the will of God and seek
His constant direction.

As I reflect back on my experience with Ben in the Bountiful Utah Temple, I
have many sweet feelings and impressions. One clear recollection is that while
I was absorbed in the grandeur of what I could see, a small child near my side
was recognizing the powerful feelings in his heart. With a gentle reminder, I
was invited not only to pause and kneel down but also to heed the Savior's
call to become as a little child--humble, meek, and ready to hear the still,
small voice of His Spirit.

I bear witness of the living reality and divine mission of the Holy Ghost and
that by the power of the Holy Ghost, we may know the truth of all things. I
testify that the gift of the Holy Ghost is Heavenly Father's precious and
unspeakable gift to all who will come unto His Son, be baptized in His name,
and receive the Holy Ghost through confirmation in His Church. Of these sacred
truths I bear personal witness in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
