# Our Only Chance

In His last discourse to His disciples prior to Gethsemane and Calvary, the
Savior declared that He was "the way, the truth, and the life" ([John
14:6](/scriptures/nt/john/14.6?lang=eng#5)). On this beautiful Easter morning,
I testify with the prophet Alma "that there is no other way ... whereby man can
be saved, only in and through Christ" ([Alma
38:9](/scriptures/bofm/alma/38.9?lang=eng#8)).

The Savior's Atonement is stunningly inclusive! "For as in Adam all die, even
so in Christ shall _all_ be made alive" ([1 Cor.
15:22](/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15.22?lang=eng#21); emphasis added). Come one,
come all, the Lord has invited. The gospel of Jesus Christ is for every man
and woman, boy and girl. He doesn't change the rules for the rich or the poor,
the married or unmarried, the Portuguese or the Chinese. The gospel is for
_every one_ of us, and the spiritual requirements and rewards are universal.
In matters pertaining to salvation, "_all_ are alike unto God" ([2 Ne.
26:33](/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.33?lang=eng#32); emphasis added). The Lord's
motives stand in stark contrast to those of Lucifer, who is obsessed with
attempting to make us feel less than who we are as sons and daughters of God.
He despises a consecrated people and delights at obscuring our vision and
enticing us away from the path that leads back to our heavenly home.

As a young BYU student I learned a little something about staying on course
when heading home. One Christmas Eve my brother and I left to drive home to
Kansas. But early in our journey we learned that a huge snowstorm was heading
our way, so we pulled out a map, identified a detour that would skirt the edge
of the storm, and headed into parts unknown. Our creative navigating proved
dangerous. Our new route was unfamiliar, and we still ran right into the
blizzard. To make matters worse, late that night as we were creeping along in
blinding snow on an obscure highway, our old Ford quit. We were stranded. And
we had absolutely no idea where we were.

Eventually we caught a ride to the nearest town, where we found that we were
still hours from home and marooned in Last Chance, Colorado. At that point
there was only one thing to do. We called home for help. In the middle of the
night our father left to come and rescue us. By the next afternoon we were all
safely home.

I'll never forget Christmas Eve in Last Chance, where we were immobilized by a
problem largely of our own making and one we were unequipped to solve. That
day our father did for us what we could not do for ourselves. Now, each one of
us is on the path towards our eternal home. And for various reasons we all
need rescue--rescue from loneliness and heartache, from despair and
disillusionment, from the consequences of innocent mistakes and blatant sin.

Where do we turn for help? "In the gift of his Son hath God prepared a more
excellent way" ([Ether 12:11](/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.11?lang=eng#10)). The
Savior isn't our last chance; He is our only chance. Our only chance to
overcome self-doubt and catch a vision of who we may become. Our only chance
to repent and have our sins washed clean. Our only chance to purify our
hearts, subdue our weaknesses, and avoid the adversary. Our only chance to
obtain redemption and exaltation. Our only chance to find peace and happiness
in this life and eternal life in the world to come.

Left to his own devices, the natural man inevitably succumbs to Satan (see
[Mosiah 3:19](/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.19?lang=eng#18)), who abandons his
prey once he lures them from the straight and narrow path. But the Savior will
guide those who follow Him _all_ the way home. Lehi's family endured an
intense wilderness experience designed to teach, test, and sanctify them.
Likewise, the path from our former home to eternal life runs right through
this earthly wilderness, where we may expect similar challenges and
difficulties. But in our journey we are not alone, for the Lord's promise to
Lehi is the same to us: "I will prepare the way before you [and] inasmuch as
ye shall keep my commandments ye shall be led towards the promised land. ...
After ye have arrived ... ye shall know that ... I, the Lord, did deliver you" ([1
Ne. 17:13-14](/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17.13-14?lang=eng#12)).

The Lord knows the way because He _is_ the way and is our only chance for
successfully negotiating mortality. His Atonement makes available all of the
power, peace, light, and strength that we need to deal with life's challenges
--those ranging from our own mistakes and sins to trials over which we have no
control but we still feel pain.

The Lord has promised to heal our broken hearts and "to set at liberty them
that are bruised" ([Luke 4:18](/scriptures/nt/luke/4.18?lang=eng#17)); to give
power to the faint, to heal the wounded soul, and to turn our weakness into
strength (see [Isa. 40:29](/scriptures/ot/isa/40.29?lang=eng#28); [Jacob
2:8](/scriptures/bofm/jacob/2.8?lang=eng#7); [Ether
12:27](/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.27?lang=eng#26)); to take upon Him our pains
and sicknesses, to blot out our transgressions if we repent, and loose the
bands of death (see [Alma
7:11-13](/scriptures/bofm/alma/7.11-13?lang=eng#10)). He promised that if we
will build our lives upon His rock, the devil will have no power over us (see
[Hel. 5:12](/scriptures/bofm/hel/5.12?lang=eng#11)). And He has vowed that He
will never leave us or forsake us (see [Heb.
13:5](/scriptures/nt/heb/13.5?lang=eng#4)). There is simply no mortal
equivalent. Not in terms of commitment, power, or love. He is our only chance.

Our responsibility is to learn to draw upon the power of the Atonement.
Otherwise we walk through mortality relying solely on our own strength. And to
do that is to invite the frustration of failure and to refuse the most
resplendent gift in time or eternity. "For what doth it profit a man if a gift
is bestowed ... and he receive not the gift?" ([D&amp;C 88:33](/scriptures/dc-
testament/dc/88.33?lang=eng#32)). My brother and I would have been foolish to
not seek or accept our father's help when we were stranded. Likewise, the Lord
is our advocate, and He "knoweth the weakness of man and how to succor them
who are tempted" ([D&amp;C 62:1](/scriptures/dc-
testament/dc/62.1?lang=eng#0)). In other words, He knows how to succor _all_
of us. But _we_ activate the power of the Atonement in our lives. We do this
by first believing in Him, by repenting, by obeying His commandments, by
partaking of sacred ordinances and keeping covenants, and by seeking after Him
in fasting and prayer, in the scriptures, and in the temple.

All of which requires our faith in the Lord. President Gordon B. Hinckley has
said that "if there is any one thing you and I need ... it is faith."[1] To have
faith in Christ is to believe in Him, follow Him, and rely on Him. And it is
to be blessed with the peace of conscience and mind that the Apostle Paul
spoke of when he said, "I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth
me" ([Philip. 4:13](/scriptures/nt/philip/4.13?lang=eng#12)).

Not long ago the Relief Society general presidency was asked to meet with two
journalists from eastern Europe who were intrigued about service performed by
our sisters in their country. We explained that from its earliest days this
grand organization of righteous women has sought to not only "relieve the poor
but to save souls."[2] When they asked if we help women with their "emotional
problems," explaining that many in their country were discouraged, we
responded that in Relief Society we study the doctrines of the gospel, and the
gospel teaches us how to be happy even when life is hard. One of the reporters
was incredulous: "Is it possible?" she asked. "Is it possible to be happy when
life is hard?" Her question tugged at me, for I knew that she did not know
where to turn for peace.

_Is_ it possible to be happy when life is hard? To feel peace amid uncertainty
and hope in the midst of cynicism? Is it possible to change, to shake off old
habits and become new again? Is it possible to live with integrity and purity
in a world that no longer values the virtues that distinguish the followers of
Christ?

Yes. The answer is yes because of Jesus Christ, whose Atonement ensures that
we need not bear the burdens of mortality alone. There is nothing this
confused world needs more, nothing that inspires a greater sense of well-
being, nothing that has greater power to strengthen families than the gospel
of Jesus Christ. President Howard W. Hunter said, "Whatever Jesus lays his
hands upon lives. If Jesus lays his hands upon a marriage, it lives. If he is
allowed to lay his hands on the family, it lives."[3] The Savior will do for
_each_ of us what He has promised to do--_if_ we will have faith in Him and
receive His gift.

Through the years I, like you, have experienced pressures and disappointments
that would have crushed me had I not been able to draw upon a source of wisdom
and strength far greater than my own. He has never forgotten or forsaken me,
and I have come to know for myself that Jesus _is_ the Christ and that this is
His Church. With Ammon I say, "[For] who can glory too much in the Lord? Yea,
who can say too much of his great power, and of his mercy ... ? Behold, ... I
cannot say the smallest part which I feel" ([Alma
26:16](/scriptures/bofm/alma/26.16?lang=eng#15)). I testify that in this, the
twilight of the dispensation of the fulness of times, when Lucifer is working
overtime to jeopardize our journey home and to separate us from the Savior's
atoning power, the only answer for _any_ of us is Jesus Christ.

May we recommit to seek after this Jesus, of whom the prophets have testified.
May we yoke ourselves to Him, draw liberally upon the matchless power of His
Atonement, and rise up as sons and daughters of God and shake off the world.
To "those who will have him to be their God" ([1 Ne.
17:40](/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17.40?lang=eng#39)), the Lord has extended a
magnificent promise: "I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand
and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round
about you, to bear you up" ([D&amp;C 84:88](/scriptures/dc-
testament/dc/84.88?lang=eng#87)). Jesus Christ is our only chance. He will
show us the way because He _is_ the way, to which I testify in the name of
Jesus Christ, amen.
