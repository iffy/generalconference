# The Twelve Apostles

In the course of organizing His Church, Jesus "went out into a mountain to
pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.

"And when it was day, he called unto him his disciples: and of them he chose
twelve, whom also he named apostles." [1]  They were called from the ordinary
paths of life.

Peter was the first called, and the Lord said to him, "I will give unto thee
the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth
shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be
loosed in heaven." [2]  This same sacred authority is inherent in the
ordination of every Apostle.

Paul taught that the apostles and prophets were called "for the perfecting of
the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of
Christ," and he declared that these offices would endure "till we all come in
the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God." [3]

The Apostles in time were gone and, with them, the keys. Paul had prophesied
of men being "carried about with every wind of doctrine." [4]

And so it was; instead of unity of faith, there came division and disunity.

It was in this circumstance that young Joseph Smith prayed to know which of
all the churches was true, and which he should join.

Joseph's vision of the Father and the Son opened this dispensation. Then came
the restoration of the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ with the same
organization that existed in the primitive Church, built upon the foundation
of apostles and prophets. [5]

Some suppose that the organization was handed to the Prophet Joseph Smith like
a set of plans and specifications for a building, with all of the details
known at the beginning. But it did not come that way. Rather, it came a piece
at a time as the Brethren were ready and as they inquired of God.

The Melchizedek Priesthood, the consummate authority given to man from God,
was restored under the hands of Peter, James, and John. By them, the Lord
said, "I have ordained you and confirmed you to be apostles, and especial
witnesses of my name, and bear the keys of your ministry and of the same
things which I revealed unto them;

"Unto whom I have committed the keys of my kingdom, and a dispensation of the
gospel for the last times." [6]

The First Presidency was in place by 1833; then two years later, in February
of 1835, came the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. And that is as it should be.
The First Presidency came first in sequence and stands first in authority.
And, true to the pattern, it was made of men called from the ordinary pursuits
of life.

With the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve in place, with the
offices of the Seventy and the Presiding Bishopric revealed, the proper order
of things prevails. But there is a difference. Perhaps President J. Reuben
Clark said it best: "Some of the General Authorities [the Apostles] have had
assigned to them a special calling; they possess a special gift; they are
sustained as prophets, seers, and revelators, which gives them a special
spiritual endowment in connection with their teaching of this people. They
have the right, the power, and the authority to declare the mind and will of
God to his people, subject to the over-all power and authority of the
President of the Church. Others of the General Authorities are not given this
special spiritual endowment." The resulting limitation "applies to every other
officer and member of the Church, for none of them is spiritually endowed as a
prophet, seer, and revelator." [7]

Furthermore, President Clark said that among those of the Twelve and the
Presidency, "only the President of the Church, the Presiding High Priest, is
sustained as Prophet, Seer, and Revelator for the Church, and he alone has the
right to receive revelations for the Church, either new or amendatory, or to
give authoritative interpretations of scriptures that shall be binding on the
Church, or change in any way the existing doctrines of the Church." [8]

It took a generation of asking and receiving before the order of things as we
know it today was firmly in place. Each move to perfect that order has come
about in response to a need and in answer to prayer. And that process
continues in our day.

"The Twelve are a Traveling Presiding High Council, to officiate in the name
of the Lord, under the direction of the Presidency of the Church, agreeable to
the institution of heaven; to build up the church, and regulate all the
affairs of the same in all nations." [9]

Where the First Presidency cannot go, the Twelve are sent "to unlock the door
of the kingdom in all places." [10]  They are commissioned to go to all the
world, for the word _Apostle_ means "one [who is] sent forth." [11]

"Wherefore," the Lord said, "in whatsoever place ye shall proclaim my name an
effectual door shall be opened unto you, that they may receive my word." [12]
And He promised, "Be thou humble; and the Lord thy God shall lead thee by the
hand, and give thee answer to thy prayers." [13]

The Twelve Apostles "are called to be ... special witnesses of the name of
Christ in all the world." [14]  Each carries that certain witness that Jesus
is the Christ. President Joseph Fielding Smith taught that "every member of
the Church should have the impressions on his soul made by the Holy Ghost that
Jesus is the Son of God indelibly pictured so that they cannot be forgotten."
[15]

From Nephi we know that "angels speak by the power of the Holy Ghost." [16]
Mormon told us that "the office of their ministry is to call men unto
repentance, and to fulfil and to do the work of the covenants of the Father,
which he hath made unto the children of men, to prepare the way among the
children of men." Mormon further explained that angels accomplish their
ministry "by declaring the word of Christ unto the chosen vessels of the Lord,
that they may bear testimony of him.

"And by so doing, the Lord God prepareth the way that the residue of men may
have faith in Christ, that the Holy Ghost may have place in their hearts,
according to the power thereof; and after this manner bringeth to pass the
Father, the covenants which he hath made unto the children of men." [17]

There is a power of discernment granted "unto such as God shall appoint ... to
watch over [his] church." [18]  To discern means "to see."

President Harold B. Lee told me once of a conversation he had with Elder
Charles A. Callis of the Quorum of the Twelve. Brother Callis had remarked
that the gift of discernment was an awesome burden to carry. To see clearly
what is ahead and yet find members slow to respond or resistant to counsel or
even rejecting the witness of the apostles and prophets brings deep sorrow.

Nevertheless, "the responsibility of leading this church" must rest upon us
until "you shall appoint others to succeed you." [19]

The Lord warned us of those few in the Church "who have professed to know my
name and have not known me, and have blasphemed against me in the midst of my
house." [20]

"Thy voice," the Lord commanded the Twelve, "shall be a rebuke unto the
transgressor; and at thy rebuke let the tongue of the slanderer cease its
perverseness." [21]

Some few within the Church openly, or perhaps far worse, in the darkness of
anonymity, reproach their leaders in the wards and stakes and in the Church,
seeking to make them "an offender for a word," [22]  as Isaiah said. To them
the Lord said:

"Cursed are all those that shall lift up the heel against mine anointed, saith
the Lord, and cry they have sinned when they have not sinned ... but have done
that which was meet in mine eyes, and which I commanded them.

"But those who cry transgression do it because they are the servants of sin,
and are the children of disobedience themselves. ...

"... because they have offended my little ones they shall be severed from the
ordinances of mine house.

"Their basket shall not be full, their houses and their barns shall perish,
and they themselves shall be despised by those that flattered them.

"They shall not have right to the priesthood, nor their posterity after them
from generation to generation." [23]

That terrible penalty will not apply to those who try as best they can to live
the gospel and sustain their leaders. Nor need it apply to those who in the
past have been guilty of indifference or even opposition, if they will repent,
confess their transgressions, and forsake them. [24]

Recently President Hinckley reminded the Brethren that, while we are men
called from the ordinary pursuits of life, there rests upon us a sacred
ministry. And we take comfort in what the Lord said to the original Twelve:
"Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you." [25]

While each feels his own limitation, there is strength in unity. Never in the
history of the Church have the Brethren of the First Presidency and the Twelve
been more united.

Each week we meet together in the temple. We open the meeting by kneeling in
prayer, and we close with prayer. Every prayer is offered in the spirit of
submission and obedience to Him who called us and whose servants and witnesses
we are.

The Lord requires that "every decision made by either of these quorums must be
by the unanimous voice of the same" and that "the decisions of these quorums ...
are to be made in all righteousness, in holiness, and lowliness of heart,
meekness and long suffering, and in faith, and virtue, and knowledge,
temperance, patience, godliness, brotherly kindness and charity." [26]  This
we earnestly strive to do.

We know that we hold the power of the priesthood "in connection with all those
who have received a dispensation at any time from the beginning of the
creation." [27]  We think of those who have preceded us in these sacred
offices, and at times we feel their presence.

We are overcome with what the Lord said of those who hold these sacred
callings: "Whatsoever they shall speak when moved upon by the Holy Ghost shall
be scripture, shall be the will of the Lord, shall be the mind of the Lord,
shall be the word of the Lord, shall be the voice of the Lord, and the power
of God unto salvation." [28]

During a very difficult time, the Lord gave the sternest warning that I know
of in all scripture. It had to do with the building of the Nauvoo Temple. The
Saints knew from experience that to proceed to build a temple would bring
terrible persecution, so they delayed. The Lord extended the time and said,
"If you do not these things at the end of the appointment ye shall be rejected
as a church, with your dead, saith the Lord your God." [29]

Often overlooked in that revelation is a marvelous promise: "If my people will
hearken unto my voice, and unto the voice of my servants whom I have appointed
to lead my people, behold, verily I say unto you, they shall not be moved out
of their place." [30]

Remember this promise; hold on to it. It should be a great comfort to those
struggling to keep a family together in a society increasingly indifferent to,
and even hostile toward, those standards which are essential to a happy
family.

The promise is a restatement of what the Lord told the multitude: "Blessed are
ye if ye shall give heed unto the words of these twelve whom I have chosen
from among you to minister unto you, and to be your servants." [31]

I repeat the promise that those who hearken to the voice of these men whom the
Lord has raised up "shall not be moved out of their place." [32]

But the promise was followed with this caution: "But if they will not hearken
to my voice, nor unto the voice of these men whom I have appointed, they shall
not be blest." [33]

The most precious thing we have to give is our witness of the Lord, our
testimony of Jesus Christ.

I certify to you that the 14 men with whom I share the ordination are indeed
Apostles. In declaring this, I say no more than the Lord has taught, no more
than may be revealed to anyone who seeks with a sincere heart and real intent
for an individual witness of the Spirit.

These men are true servants of the Lord; give heed to their counsel. So, too,
with the Seventy, who as especial witnesses carry an apostolic responsibility,
and the Bishopric, worthy men of God. So, too, with the brethren and sisters
across the world who are called to lead, who have earned that knowledge
precious above all else.

There are limits to what the Spirit permits us to say. [34]  And so I close
with my witness, my special witness, that Jesus is the Christ, that through a
prophet-president He presides over this, "the only true and living church upon
the face of the whole earth." [35]  In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
