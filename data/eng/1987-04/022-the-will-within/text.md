# The Will Within

A few months ago I stood before a capacity audience in the Marriott Center on
the campus of Brigham Young University. Mine was the responsibility to speak,
to lift, to motivate, to inspire. There came to my mind the realization that
here were men and women of promise. They represented the hopes, the dreams,
and the aspirations of parents, of family, of teachers, of God. All were
participants in the passing parade of mortality. Some were gifted in the arts,
others leaned toward the humanities, while some found their talents prompted a
study of the natural or physical sciences. These students stood on the stage
of study. Soon they would disperse to make their marks in life, to fulfill the
measure of their creation, and to learn from their own lives those lessons
which would prepare them for the exaltation they seek.

My thoughts turned to others striving to become master craftsmen through
apprenticeship and experience. Then I reflected on that vast throng who had
abandoned preparation, formed undesirable friendships, and adopted habits and
practices which diverted them from that pathway which leads to perfection and
enticed them along one of the many detours where sorrow, discouragement, and
destruction await.

The wayward son, the willful daughter, the pouting husband, the nagging wife--
all can change. There can occur a parting of the clouds, a break in the storm.
Maturity comes, friendships alter, circumstances vary. "Cast in concrete" need
not describe human behavior.

From the perspective of eternity, our sojourn in this life is ever so brief.
Detours are costly; they must be shunned. The spiritual nature within us
should not be dominated by the physical. It behooves each of us to remember
who he or she is and what God expects him or her to become.

The poet Wordsworth, in his inspired _Intimations of Immortality,_ inclined
our thoughts to that heavenly home from whence each of us came:

_Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting:_

_The soul that rises with us, our life's star,_

_Hath had elsewhere its setting,_

_And cometh from afar:_

_Not in entire forgetfulness,_

_And not in utter nakedness,_

_But trailing clouds of glory do we come_

_From God, who is our home._

In finding and trailing this spiritual contact with the infinite, we will feel
the touch of inspiration and know that God will guide us as we put in Him our
trust. That wise and righteous man, Job, declared the profound truth: "There
is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth ...
understanding" ([Job 32:8](/scriptures/ot/job/32.8?lang=eng#7)). It is this
inspiration which we at times allow to grow dim, causing us to wander far
below the level of our possibilities.

During the Great Depression, the homeless, the downtrodden, the unemployed
"rode the rails" that passed not far from our home. On numerous occasions,
there would be a soft knock on the back door. When I opened the door, there I
would see a man, sometimes two, ill-clothed, ill-fed, ill-schooled. Generally,
such a visitor held in his hand the familiar cap. His hair would be tousled,
his face unshaven. The question was always the same: "Could you spare some
food?" My dear mother invariably responded with a pleasant, "Come in and sit
down at the table." She would then prepare a ham sandwich, cut a piece of
cake, and pour a glass of milk. Mother would ask the visitor about his home,
his family, his life. She provided hope and words of encouragement. Before
leaving, the visitor would pause to express a gracious thank-you. I would note
that a smile of content had replaced a look of despair. Eyes that were dull
now shone with new purpose. Love, that noblest attribute of the human soul,
can work wonders.

In our journey on earth, we discover that life is made up of challenges--they
just differ from one person to another. We are success oriented, striving to
become "wonder women" and "super men." Any intimation of failure can cause
panic, even despair. Who among us cannot remember moments of failure?

One such moment came to me as a young basketball player. The game was close--
hotly contested--when the coach called me from the bench to run a key play.
For some reason which I shall never understand, I took the pass and dribbled
the ball right through the opposing team. I jumped high toward the basket;
and, as the basketball left my fingertips, I came to the abrupt realization
that I was shooting for the wrong basket. I offered the shortest prayer I have
ever spoken: "Dear Father, don't let that ball go in." My prayer was answered,
but my ordeal was just beginning. I heard a loud cheer erupt from the adoring
fans: "We want Monson, we want Monson, we want Monson ... OUT!" The coach
obliged.

Not long ago I read about an incident that occurred in the life of President
Harry S. Truman after he had retired and was back in Independence, Missouri.
He was at Truman Library, talking with some elementary school students and
answering their questions. Finally, a question came from an owlish little boy.
"Mr. President," he said, "was you popular when you was a boy?" The President
looked at the boy and answered, "Why, no. I was never popular. The popular
boys were the ones who were good at games and had big, tight fists. I was
never like that. Without my glasses, I was blind as a bat, and to tell the
truth, I was kind of a sissy." The little boy started to applaud, and then
everyone else did, too." (_Vital Speeches,_ Feb. 1983, p. 6.)

Our responsibility is to rise from mediocrity to competence, from failure to
achievement. Our task is to become our best selves. One of God's greatest
gifts to us is the joy of trying again, for no failure ever need be final. In
1902, the poetry editor of the _Atlantic Monthly_ returned a sheaf of poems to
a 28-year-old poet with this curt note: "Our magazine has no room for your
vigorous verse." The poet was Robert Frost. In 1894, the rhetoric teacher at
Harrow in England wrote on a 16-year-old's report card, "A conspicuous lack of
success." The 16-year-old was Winston Churchill.

President Theodore Roosevelt said, "It is not the critic who counts, not the
man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds
could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in
the arena" (Clifton Fadiman, ed., _The American Treasury: 1455-1955,_ New
York: Harper and Brothers, 1955, p. 689).

We know men and women can change--and change for the better. No more vivid
example is recorded than the life of Saul of Tarsus. The sacred record reveals
that Saul threatened the disciples of the Lord. Then came that light from
heaven and the voice saying unto him: "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?

"And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou
persecutest" ([Acts 9:4-5](/scriptures/nt/acts/9.4-5?lang=eng#3)).

Saul's answer is a model for each of us: "Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?"
([Acts 9:6](/scriptures/nt/acts/9.6?lang=eng#5)). Saul the persecutor became
Paul the proselyter. Night had turned to day. Darkness had yielded to light.

Simon Peter, that fisherman who left his nets and followed the Lord, had his
time of struggle. He had been weak and fearful and had denied his Lord with an
oath. Then there came change. Never again would he deny or desert his Lord. He
found his place in the kingdom of God.

We have the example of Alma the Younger, who turned his back on sinful
practices and wasteful ways. Conversion came. He became an exponent of truth.
His tender words of counsel to his sons Helaman and Corianton are literary
classics. To Helaman: "O, remember, my son, and learn wisdom in thy youth;
yea, learn in thy youth to keep the commandments of God" ([Alma
37:35](/scriptures/bofm/alma/37.35?lang=eng#34)). To Corianton: "Suffer not
yourself to be led away by any vain or foolish thing" ([Alma
39:11](/scriptures/bofm/alma/39.11?lang=eng#10)).

Then and now, as President David O. McKay so consistently taught, the gospel
of Jesus Christ can make bad men good and good men better, can alter human
nature and change human lives.

Change for the better can come to all. In December of 1985 the First
Presidency proclaimed "An Invitation to Come Back." To the inactive, the
critical, the transgressor, the message declared: "'Come back. Come back and
feast at the table of the Lord, and taste again the sweet and satisfying
fruits of fellowship with the Saints'" (_Ensign, _Mar. 1986, p. 88). Hundreds,
if not thousands, have responded to this invitation. Their lives have taken on
new meaning. Their families have been blessed. They have drawn closer to God.

In the private sanctuary of one's own conscience lies that spirit, that
determination to cast off the old person and to measure up to the stature of
true potential. But the way is rugged, and the course is strenuous. So
discovered John Helander from Goteborg, Sweden. John is twenty-six years of
age and is handicapped, in that it is difficult for him to coordinate his
motions.

At a youth conference in Kungsbacka, Sweden, John took part in a 1500-meter
running race. He had no chance to win. Rather, his was the opportunity to be
humiliated, mocked, derided, scorned. Perhaps John remembered another who
lived long ago and far away. Wasn't He mocked? Wasn't He derided? Wasn't He
scorned? But He prevailed. He won His race. Maybe John could win his.

What a race it was! Struggling, surging, pressing, the runners bolted far
beyond John. There was wonderment among the spectators. Who is this runner who
lags so far behind? The participants on their second lap of this two-lap race
passed John while he was but halfway through the first lap. Tension mounted as
the runners pressed toward the tape. Who would win? Who would place second?
Then came the final burst of speed; the tape was broken. The crowd cheered;
the winner was proclaimed.

The race was over--or was it? Who is this contestant who continues to run when
the race is ended? He crosses the finish line on but his first lap. Doesn't
the foolish lad know he has lost? Ever onward he struggles, the only
participant now on the track. This is his race. This must be his victory. No
one among the vast throng of spectators leaves. Every eye is on this valiant
runner. He makes the final turn and moves toward the finish line. There is
awe; there is admiration. Every spectator sees himself running his own race of
life. As John approaches the finish line, the audience, as one, rises to its
feet. There is a loud applause of acclaim. Stumbling, falling, exhausted but
victorious, John Helander breaks the newly tightened tape. (Officials are
human beings, too.) The cheering echoes for miles. And just maybe, if the ear
is carefully attuned, that Great Scorekeeper--even the Lord--can be heard to
say, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant" ([Matt.
25:21](/scriptures/nt/matt/25.21?lang=eng#20)).

Each of us is a runner in the race of life. Comforting is the fact that there
are many runners. Reassuring is the knowledge that our eternal Scorekeeper is
understanding. Challenging is the truth that each must run. But you and I do
not run alone. That vast audience of family, friends, and leaders will cheer
our courage, will applaud our determination as we rise from our stumblings and
pursue our goal. The race of life is not for sprinters running on a level
track. The course is marked by pitfalls and checkered with obstacles. We take
confidence from the hymn:

_Fear not, I am with thee; oh, be not dismayed,_

_For I am thy God and will still give thee aid._

_I'll strengthen thee, help thee, and cause thee to stand,_

_Upheld by my righteous, ... omnipotent hand. ..._

_The soul that on Jesus hath leaned for repose_

_I will not, I cannot, desert to his foes;_

_That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake,_

_I'll never, no never, no never forsake!_

Let us shed any thought of failure. Let us discard any habit that may hinder.
Let us seek; let us obtain the prize prepared for all, even exaltation in the
celestial kingdom of God. This is my earnest prayer, in the name of Jesus
Christ, amen.
