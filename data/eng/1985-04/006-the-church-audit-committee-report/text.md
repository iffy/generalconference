# The Church Audit Committee Report

We have reviewed the annual financial report of the Church as of 31 December
1984 and operations for the year then ended. The financial statements and
operations reviewed by the committee include the general funds of the Church
and of other controlled organizations, the accounts of which are maintained by
the Finance and Records Department of the Church. We have also examined the
budgeting, accounting, and auditing procedures employed and the manner in
which funds are received and expenditures are controlled. We determined that
expenditures of general Church funds were authorized by the First Presidency
and by budgetary procedures. The budget is authorized by the Council on
Disposition of Tithes, composed of the First Presidency, the Council of the
Twelve, and the Presiding Bishopric. The Budget and Appropriations Committee,
in weekly meetings, administers the expenditure of funds under the budget.

Modern accounting technology and equipment are employed by the Finance and
Records Department and other departments in keeping abreast of rapid Church
expansion and changing methods of electronic data processing.

The Auditing Department, which is independent of all other departments,
functions in the threefold capacity of performing financial audits,
operational audits, and audits of computer systems employed by the Church.
These services are conducted on a continual basis for all Church departments
and other Church-controlled organizations, the accounts of which are
maintained under the direction of the Finance and Records Department. These
comprise worldwide operations including missions, schools, administrative
offices, and departmental activities conducted in foreign countries. The
extent and scope of the Auditing Department services in safeguarding the
resources of the Church are expanding to encompass the growth and widening
activities of the Church. The audits of local funds of wards and stakes are
performed by stake auditors, the reports of which are reviewed by the Church
Auditing Department. Incorporated businesses owned or controlled by the
Church, for which accounts are not maintained in the Finance and Records
Department, are audited by the Auditing Department, professional auditing
firms, or governmental regulatory agencies.

Based on our review of the annual financial report and other accounting data,
and our study of the accounting and auditing methods by which financial
operations are controlled, together with continuing discussions with personnel
of the Finance and Records Department and Auditing departments, and Church
legal representatives, we are of the opinion that the general funds of the
Church received and expended during the year 1984 have been properly accounted
for in accordance with established procedures outlined herein.

Respectfully submitted,

CHURCH AUDIT COMMITTEE
