# The Church Audit Committee Report

Dear Brethren: The Church Audit Committee consists of three members who are
independent of all Church officers, employees, departments, and Church-
affiliated entities. We report directly to the First Presidency and have
access to all records and personnel necessary to perform our responsibilities.

The Church also has an auditing department that is independent of all other
Church operations and departments. The Church Auditing Department is separate
from the Church Audit Committee. The Church Auditing Department's staff
consists of certified public accountants and other professionally qualified
auditors. It has established procedures for audits of Church operations in
accordance with recognized professional auditing standards. This includes
monitoring contributions and expenditures of local ecclesiastical units.

The Church Audit Committee has reviewed the financial policies and procedures
that provide controls over contributions and expenditures of Church funds and
that safeguard assets of the Church. We have also reviewed budgeting,
accounting and reporting, and auditing systems for the year ended 31 December
1997. Expenditures of Church funds for 1997 were authorized by the Council on
the Disposition of the Tithes according to written policies. The Council is
composed of the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and the
Presiding Bishopric, as prescribed under revelation. Administration of
approved budgets is controlled through the Budget Department under the
direction of the Appropriation and Budget Committees.

Church-affiliated businesses are managed by professionals who report to
independent boards of directors. These businesses maintain their own
accounting and reporting systems in compliance with accepted business
practices and are audited by the Church Auditing Department and/or independent
public accounting firms. Brigham Young University and other institutions of
higher education are audited by independent public accounting firms.

Based upon our review of financial, budgeting, and other control policies and
procedures, and our review of all audit reports issued in 1997 and responses
thereto, the Audit Committee is of the opinion that, in all material respects,
Church contributions received and expended during the year ended 31 December
1997 have been managed in accordance with revelation and established Church
policies and procedures.

Respectfully submitted,

CHURCH AUDIT COMMITTEE

Frank M. McCord
