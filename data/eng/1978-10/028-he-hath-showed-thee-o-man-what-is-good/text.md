# “He Hath Showed Thee, O Man, What Is Good”

I shall begin by bearing a testimony. I am certain and bear the witness, by
applying the principle just stated by Brother McConkie, that the calling which
has come to me and my colleagues in the last two days is as much the
inspiration of the Lord as was my call thirty-three years ago. I should like
you to know that.

In this day of mechanical marvels my mind harkens back to the days of my
childhood. I suppose that is natural enough for those upon whom age descends.

I remember well the old one-room rock meetinghouse of the Second Ward on
Seventh South between Fourth and Fifth East in Salt Lake City. This particular
ward was one of the gathering places for members from Denmark. The bishop,
Heber C. Iverson, could speak their language. In fast day meetings,
testimonies were often unintelligible to me as the Saints struggled to testify
in English, their new tongue. In Sunday School the room was divided into
classrooms by green curtains hanging from wires overhead. If I was not
interested in what my teacher was saying, I could choose from five other
classes, all of which I could hear. It was always interesting to try to solve
the problem of the identity of the boy who kept poking me in the back through
the curtain at my rear.

Even in those early years I somehow grasped the idea that I alone must work
out my salvation, and that I could not blame anyone else if I didn't. Today I
cannot identify the exact teaching of this principle, but I suspect that it
came from those testimonies I heard in the Second Ward, the Sunday School
class, my parents, and the repetition of the second Article of Faith [[A of F
1:2](/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.2?lang=eng#1)], which I repeated many times in
that day. This article states: "We believe that men will be punished for their
own sins, and not for Adam's transgression."

I made an early resolve to be good and thus escape the punishment. The word
_punish_ was also quite common. My father and mother used it to explain to me
why I was being spanked, both before the event and after. I grew up with the
sure knowledge that I was responsible for my own acts of good and evil.

I have come to know that the acts of men, once governed by the Ten
Commandments and the Sermon on the Mount, are in my day to a great extent
governed by the whims of the persons committing the act. The excuse is that
one has to "do his own thing." And apparently the commandments are forgotten.
But they have not been cancelled. They still stand as a beacon light on the
way to eternal life--which is, of course, eternal happiness and joy.

The stern, short statements of the Ten Commandments have always held me in
awe. They become more sharply etched when I see some of the acts of people.
Let me quote, in part, Abinadi, who repeated them to King Noah:

  1. Thou shalt have no other God before me. 
  2. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image. 
  3. Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain. 
  4. Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. 
  5. Honor thy father and thy mother. 
  6. Thou shalt not kill. 
  7. Thou shalt not commit adultery. 
  8. Thou shalt not steal. 
  9. Thou shalt not bear false witness. 
  10. Thou shalt not covet. (See [Mosiah 12:35-36](/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/12.35-36?lang=eng#34); [Mosiah 13:12-24](/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/13.12-24?lang=eng#11).) 

Abinadi told those present with King Noah that he perceived that these Ten
Commandments were, to quote him, "not written in your hearts" ([Mosiah
13:11](/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/13.11?lang=eng#10)).

But there they stand, the immutable word from the great meeting of Moses with
his Maker amid the thunderings and lightnings of Sinai.

In our day the necessity of following the Ten Commandments is all the more
urgent. Five of them were repeated in section 42 of the Doctrine and
Covenants. [[D&amp;C 42](/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42?lang=eng)] Others are
spoken of in other sections. I early resolved to keep them all.

Incidentally, to this generation of young fathers I suggest that they spend
overtime teaching their children the fifth commandment, which tells them to
honor their parents.

We teach children they must not lie and steal, but do little to have them
understand that adolescent rebellion is a flagrant breaking of the commandment
to honor parents. To make the teaching effective, parents must live to deserve
the honor children are commanded to give them. It is devastating to a child to
learn that his father does not have integrity.

One day I came upon some words of Micah which seemed to me to state my line of
conduct. I quote them, for even now they arouse the best that is in me:

"He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of
thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?"
([Micah 6:8](/scriptures/ot/micah/6.8?lang=eng#7)).

"To do justly"--I desire that. "To love mercy"--my heart swells at the
thought. And "to walk humbly with thy God" brings me close to him. These
thoughts are repeated in section 11, verse 12 of the Doctrine and Covenants
[[D&amp;C 11:12](/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/11.12?lang=eng#11)].

Later I heard Sister Jessie Evans Smith sing a solo as part of a great
Tabernacle Choir number. Anyone who ever heard her sing those words was lifted
into resolve to make his life conform to the teaching. In the words from Psalm
24 the Psalmist first asks two questions: "Who shall ascend into the hill of
the Lord? or who shall stand in his holy place?" The answer comes with
startling simplicity: "He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath
not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully." Then comes the
promise: "He shall receive the blessing from the Lord, and righteousness from
the God of his salvation." ([Ps.
24:3-5](/scriptures/ot/ps/24.3-5?lang=eng#2).) The Psalmist then goes on to
assert that the generation thus obedient is the generation that truly seeks
his face.

These statements of the qualities of character which mark the righteous can be
held in our hearts as a guide in those situations which confront us in our
daily intercourse with our fellowmen. We discover then that it is not
difficult to follow the teaching of the Prophet Joseph Smith when he declared
that we have as our standard of daily conduct to be "honest, true, chaste,
benevolent, virtuous, and [to do] good to all men" ([A of F
1:13](/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.13?lang=eng#12)). For if one has clean hands
and a pure heart, does justly, loves mercy, seeks not vanity, and walks
humbly, the temptation to violate the Decalogue will hardly ever enter into
his head.

I testify that he who obeys the commandments and thus seeks the virtuous,
righteous life will find the pearl of great price of knowledge of the Son of
God who is our Savior, and, finding this, will have joy. If in addition he
loves and serves his fellowmen, he will add a chain of pearls and will find
eternal life in the presence of his Heavenly Father and that Savior.

We obey the ordinances which make exaltation possible.

We follow and obey the code of conduct which makes it certain.

This dual obedience, faithfully kept, is our surest way of bearing testimony
that we honor the Lord God, keep his commandments, and sustain President
Kimball as his prophet. These are my desires as I bear witness of the truth
that the Lord Jesus Christ is our Savior. In his holy name, amen.
