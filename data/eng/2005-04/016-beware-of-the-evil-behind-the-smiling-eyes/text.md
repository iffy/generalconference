# Beware of the Evil behind the Smiling Eyes

Tonight I speak to you young men, you whom President Gordon B. Hinckley has
described as "the finest generation."[1] Across the world we see your
goodness. I pray that you will feel that my words are personally for you, a
son of God, working hard to do what's right.

I'd like to tell you of an experience of a faithful Latter-day Saint who is a
good friend of mine. I'll refer to him only as "my friend" for reasons you
will understand.

Working as a special agent for the FBI, my friend investigated organized crime
groups transporting illegal drugs into the United States.

On one occasion, he and another agent approached an apartment where they
believed a known drug dealer was distributing cocaine. My friend describes
what happened:

"We knocked on the door of the drug dealer. The suspect opened the door, and
upon seeing us, tried to block our view. But it was too late; we could see the
cocaine on his table.

"A man and a woman who were at the table immediately began removing the
cocaine. We had to prevent them from destroying the evidence, so I quickly
pushed the drug suspect who was blocking the door to the side. As I pushed
him, my eyes met his. Strangely, he did not appear angry or afraid. He was
smiling at me.

"His eyes and disarming smile gave me the impression that he was harmless, so
I quickly left him and started to move toward the table. The suspect was now
behind me. At that instant, I had the distinct, powerful impression come into
my mind: 'Beware of the evil behind the smiling eyes.'

"I immediately turned back toward the suspect. His hand was in his large front
pocket. Instinctively I grabbed his hand and pulled it from his pocket. Only
then did I see, clutched in his hand, the semiautomatic pistol ready to fire.
A flurry of activity followed, and I disarmed the man."[2]

Later, in another case, the drug dealer was convicted of murder and boasted
that he would have also killed my friend had he not turned around at that very
moment.

I have often thought of the communication that came into his mind: "Beware of
the evil behind the smiling eyes." This is what I want to talk to you about
tonight.

Let's begin with what we know. Good comes from God; evil comes from the
devil.[3] They are not, however, equal forces that are fighting each other in
the universe. At the head of all that is good is the Christ--He who is the
Only Begotten of the Father, who created our world and numerous others. Our
Redeemer is a resurrected and perfect being.[4] I know He lives.

The devil, on the other hand, "persuadeth men to do evil."[5] "He [has] fallen
from heaven, ... [has] become miserable forever,"[6] and now works "that all men
might be miserable like unto himself."[7] He is a liar and a loser.[8]

The power of the Savior and the power of the devil are not truly
comparable.[9] On this planet, however, evil has been allowed a position of
influence to give us the chance to choose between good and evil. The scripture
says: "God gave unto man that he should act for himself. [And] man could not
act for himself ... [unless] he was enticed by ... one or the other."[10]

The choice between good and evil is at the very heart of our experience on
earth. In the final review of our lives, it will not really matter if we were
rich or poor, if we were athletic or not, if we had friends or were often
forgotten.

We can work, study, laugh and have fun, dance, sing, and enjoy many different
experiences. These are a wonderful part of life, but they are not central to
why we are here.[11] The opportunity to choose good over evil is precisely why
we are here.[12]

Not one of us would say, "I want to choose evil." We all want to choose the
right. However, the choice of good over evil is not always easy, because evil
frequently lurks behind smiling eyes. Listen to these warnings:

"Take heed ... that ye do not judge that which is evil to be of God."[13]

"Ye must watch and pray always lest ye enter into temptation; for Satan
desireth to have you."[14]

"Satan hath sought to deceive you, that he might overthrow you."[15]

The message is: Beware of the evil behind the smiling eyes!

I have known a few young men who began with every intention to stay firm in
their loyalty to the Savior but who slipped from the path because they did not
see the evil behind eyes that appeared quite harmless. They saw the fun, the
pleasure, the acceptance, but they did not see the other consequences.

How, then, can we discern the evil behind something that doesn't appear evil?

You already know the answers, but here are a few thoughts:

First, talk to your parents. Does that sound like a revolutionary idea? We
fathers know we are far from perfect, but we love you, and along with your
mothers, have a deep interest in your choosing the right.

Next, follow the prophet. These 15 men we sustain as prophets, seers, and
revelators are given divine power to see what we sometimes do not see.
President Hinckley has given us clear and specific counsel about the evil
behind the smiling eyes.[16] And you have the inspired guidance in the booklet
_For the Strength of Youth._[17] As you apply President Hinckley's counsel,
the Lord has promised that He "will disperse the powers of darkness from
before you."[18] You will see the evil behind the smiling eyes, and its appeal
will leave you.

Very importantly, let the Holy Ghost be your guide. The Lord has promised us
that as we live righteously, the still, small voice will come into our mind
and into our heart.[19] You have felt this influence. You know this voice.[20]

The gift of the Holy Ghost is a spiritual gift. It is sensitive and will not
be associated with unworthiness. You cannot offend or ignore it one day and
expect it to strengthen you the next day. But as you heed its promptings and
remain righteous, it will grow stronger within you. The Holy Ghost warned my
friend of physical danger; the Holy Ghost will also warn you of spiritual
danger.

Finally, gain your own testimony of the Savior. Pray passionately. Read the
Book of Mormon when no one is watching. Take time alone to think about who
Jesus really is and how His life and sacrifice are important to you.

Remember the example of the young Joseph Smith. When he lit the candle at
night to read the Bible, it was because he wanted to. When he went into the
grove to pray, he went alone.[21]

As we increase our understanding and love for the Savior, His light will
illuminate everything around us. We then will see evil for what it is.[22]

I know that Jesus Christ is our Savior. Words cannot describe His greatness
and glory, His majesty and magnificence. He appeared with His Father to the
Prophet Joseph Smith. President Gordon B. Hinckley is the prophet of God
today. Brethren, we hold His holy priesthood. As we remain worthy, we will be
blessed to see the evil behind the smiling eyes. I so testify in the name of
Jesus Christ, amen.
