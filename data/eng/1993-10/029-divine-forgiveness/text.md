# Divine Forgiveness

The Savior of the world, the Redeemer of all God's children, Jesus of
Nazareth, has power to forgive sins. His own witness of such power is recorded
in the New Testament (see [Matt.
9:6](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/9.6?lang=eng#5); [Mark
2:10](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/mark/2.10?lang=eng#9); [Luke 5:20,
24](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/5.20%2C24?lang=eng#19)). His
Apostles Peter and Paul testified of this truth (see [Acts
5:31](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/acts/5.31?lang=eng#30); [Acts
13:38-39](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/acts/13.38-39?lang=eng#37); [Eph.
1:7](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/eph/1.7?lang=eng#6)), as did also the
prophets of the Book of Mormon (see [Enos
1:5](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/enos/1.5?lang=eng#4); [Mosiah
4:3](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4.3?lang=eng#2); [Moro.
6:8](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/6.8?lang=eng#7)) and of modern
times (see [D&amp;C 61:2](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-
testament/dc/61.2?lang=eng#1)).

Through the centuries, many have received great joy and peace of mind through
understanding and accepting the Lord's forgiveness. Yet, many others
apparently continue to bear the burden of guilt, remorse, and self-doubt
because of an incomplete understanding and testimony of the doctrine of
Christ.

Recently I was in private conversation with one who, having committed a
serious transgression, had also made intense effort to repent and receive
forgiveness from those personally offended, from the Church, and from the
Lord. When I asked, "Do you feel forgiven by your Heavenly Father?" he
answered hesitantly with an affirmative but qualified response. "How do we
obtain divine forgiveness?" I asked.

He spoke of how he had forsaken his transgressive behavior of the past,
confessed to proper priesthood authorities, and attempted to make restitution
to those offended. He further described his efforts to live according to
gospel principles and Church standards.

The Savior and his atoning sacrifice were not mentioned. The underlying
assumption seemed to be that divine forgiveness is obtained through those
steps of repentance limited to changing one's behavior. Despite the brother's
earnest efforts to repent, he appeared to be burdened still by remorse and
regret and to feel that he must continue to pay for his sins.

Unfortunately, this is not an isolated case. Others, to my knowledge, are
burdened by past mistakes, large and small, because of an incomplete or
incorrect understanding of our Father's plan of redemption and mercy. Those so
burdened may unnecessarily struggle through life without the joy and peace of
mind which are the intended result of true repentance and divine forgiveness.

One who assumes that he can or must pay the price for his sins and thereby
earn divine forgiveness will not feel free to continue progress toward
realizing his divine potential, that is, eternal life.

The fact is we cannot save ourselves.

The best source through which a correct understanding of how forgiveness may
be obtained is the Book of Mormon. Let us consider some examples of its
teachings.

Enos recorded for us his experience, alone in the forest, remembering the
words of his father concerning eternal life:

"And my soul hungered; and I kneeled down before my Maker, and I cried unto
him in mighty prayer and supplication for mine own soul; ...

"And there came a voice unto me, saying: Enos, thy sins are forgiven thee. ...

"... Wherefore, my guilt was swept away.

"And I said: Lord, how is it done?

"And he said unto me: Because of thy faith in Christ" ([Enos
1:4-8](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/enos/1.4-8?lang=eng#3)).

How is it done? The question each of us may ponder. Again we turn to the Book
of Mormon for additional understanding.

Father Lehi teaches us that the divine purpose of our mortal probation
requires us to experience opposition in all things and, knowing good from
evil, to exercise our moral agency, make choices, and be accountable for the
consequences (see [2 Ne.
2](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.title?lang=eng)).

We learn from the prophet Alma that we are subject to divine law, which all
have transgressed in some respect, making us subject to the demands of justice
(see [Alma 42:14,
18](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/42.14%2C18?lang=eng#13)). God's
justice is based upon divine laws, under which we receive what we deserve
according to our disobedience or obedience to the law.

Justice affords no forgiveness for transgressors but imposes penalties (see
[D&amp;C 82:4](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-
testament/dc/82.4?lang=eng#3)). None is exempt (see [D&amp;C
107:84](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.84?lang=eng#83)).
After all we can do to repent, we are still subject to the demands of justice
and its penalties, which we cannot satisfy.

However, we learn from Alma of our Father's plan of mercy, whereby the Son of
God would atone for the sins of the world and "appease the demands of justice,
that God might be a perfect, just God, and a merciful God also" ([Alma
42:15](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/42.15?lang=eng#14)).

The Savior's vicarious sacrifice satisfies the justice of God. Therefore, God
extends his mercy, whereby we may receive forgiveness of our personal
transgressions through faith in the Redeemer, followed by obedience to the
laws and ordinances of the gospel.

Father Lehi taught his son Jacob:

"Wherefore, redemption cometh in and through the Holy Messiah; for he is full
of grace and truth.

"Behold, he offereth himself a sacrifice for sin, to answer the ends of the
law, unto all those who have a broken heart and a contrite spirit" ([2 Ne.
2:6-7](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.6-7?lang=eng#5)).

The beginning and completion of repentance leading to forgiveness is faith in
Jesus Christ, who is the "author and the finisher of [our] faith" ([Moro.
6:4](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/6.4?lang=eng#3)). Our faith in
him as Savior and Redeemer engenders in us godly sorrow for our
transgressions, a broken heart and a contrite spirit, and a sense of personal
accountability. There follows a change in attitude and a turning toward God.

We resolve to forsake disobedience, even carelessness, and strive better to
know and love our Father in Heaven and to obey his laws and commandments.
Throughout, we pray for our Father's forgiveness, for strength to resist
temptation, and for inspiration to fill our lives with that which is good and
pleasing to the Lord. We seek the forgiveness of individuals whom we may have
wronged and attempt restitution to the extent possible.

If our past behavior is such as to affect our standing in the Church, we
confess to appropriate Church authorities and, if necessary, submit to Church
discipline, which is not for the purpose of punishment only but is intended to
heal and renew.

Throughout the repentance process we have feelings of regret, remorse, and
guilt, which cause us to suffer. However, our individual suffering does not
satisfy the demands of justice which follow disobedience to divine law. We
cannot pay the price for our sins.

The resurrected Christ has said, "For behold, I, God, have suffered these
things for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent" ([D&amp;C
19:16](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/19.16?lang=eng#15)). To
the Nephites he declared, "Return unto me, and repent of your sins, and be
converted, that _I may heal you_" ([3 Ne.
9:13](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9.13?lang=eng#12); italics
added).

The Lord's gift of forgiveness, however, is not complete until it is accepted.
True and complete repentance is a process by which we may become reconciled
with God and accept the divine gift of forgiveness.

In the words of Nephi, "It is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do"
([2 Ne. 25:23](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.23?lang=eng#22)).

The effect of the infinite, atoning sacrifice was twofold: First, resurrection
and immortality for all, unconditionally granted. Second, eternal life for
each one who fulfills the prescribed conditions, which are faith in Jesus
Christ as Savior and Redeemer, followed by repentance.

Then we must qualify for and receive the saving and exalting ordinances of the
gospel with their associated covenants, continuously striving to keep those
covenants and obey the commandments of God.

Being mortal, and despite our resolve and efforts, we will continue to fall
short of perfection. However, with Nephi of old, conscious of our weaknesses,
temptations, and past mistakes, we may say, "Nevertheless, I know in whom I
have trusted" ([2 Ne.
4:19](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/4.19?lang=eng#18)). There
follows a natural resolve to renew our efforts.

Essential to receiving divine forgiveness are personal, individual recognition
and acceptance of our Father's mercy, made available to us by the atoning
sacrifice of Jesus Christ and a renewed covenant to obey the principles of the
gospel.

Examples of this process and its results are found in the Book of Mormon.
Having been taught the doctrine of the Atonement, the people of King Benjamin,
conscious of their past transgressions, pleaded for mercy that by the atoning
blood of Christ they might receive forgiveness of their sins, for, said they,
"We believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God. ...

"[And] the Spirit of the Lord came upon them, and they were filled with joy,
having received a remission of their sins, and having peace of conscience,
because of the exceeding faith which they had in Jesus Christ" ([Mosiah
4:2-3](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4.2-3?lang=eng#1)).

Each of us may ask, "How may I know that I am forgiven?"

Having completed the steps of repentance, relying upon the grace and mercy of
God, it is natural for us to testify of the Savior and his atoning sacrifice
and to strive to be an example of the believers.

From Elder Bruce R. McConkie, an Apostle of Jesus Christ, we receive these
comforting words:

"The relationship between the bearing of testimony by the power of the Holy
Ghost and the forgiveness of sins illustrates a glorious gospel truth. It is
that whenever faithful saints gain the companionship of the Holy Spirit, they
are clean and pure before the Lord, for the Spirit will not dwell in an
unclean tabernacle. Hence, they thereby receive a remission of those sins
committed after baptism" (_The Mortal Messiah: From Bethlehem to Calvary,_ 4
vols., Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1980, 3:40-41, n. 1).

The central core of the gospel is the vicarious sacrifice of the Savior, which
satisfies divine justice and makes operative God's mercy, resulting in a
universal, unconditional resurrection and the possibility of eternal life for
each one who accepts Jesus Christ as Redeemer and obeys the principles,
ordinances, and covenants of the gospel.

The ancient prophet Isaiah taught us, "Cease to do evil;

"Learn to do well. ...

"Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they
be red like crimson, they shall be as wool" ([Isa.
1:16-18](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/isa/1.16-18?lang=eng#15)).

And further, "Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows. ...

"He was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the
chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed"
([Isa. 53:4-5](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/isa/53.4-5?lang=eng#3)).

The prophet of this dispensation, Joseph Smith, and his companion Sidney
Rigdon gave testimony of the gospel, as recorded in the 76th section of the
Doctrine and Covenants. Each of us may receive _a similar_ spiritual witness,
and therefore I suggest that we may express their testimony as our own _in
these words:_

"And this is the gospel ...

"That he came into the world, even Jesus, to be crucified for [me], and to
bear [my] sins ... , and to sanctify [me], and to cleanse [me] from all
unrighteousness;

"That through him [I] might be saved" ([D&amp;C
76:40-42](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-
testament/dc/76.40-42?lang=eng#39)).

In conclusion, these verses from a favorite hymn:

_How gentle God's commands!_

_How kind his precepts are!_

_Come, cast your burdens on the Lord_

_And trust his constant care. ..._

_Why should this anxious load_

_Press down your weary mind?_

_Haste to your Heav'nly Father's throne_

_And sweet refreshment find._

_His goodness stands approved,_

_Unchanged from day to day;_

_I'll drop my burden at his feet_

_And bear a song away._

To these truths which I have sought to teach I bear solemn, personal witness,
in the sacred name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, amen.
