# Born of God

"What think ye of Christ?" ([Matt.
22:42](/scriptures/nt/matt/22.42?lang=eng#41).) That question, posed by our
Lord, has challenged the world for centuries.

Fortunately for us, God has provided modern scripture, another testament, even
the Book of Mormon, for the convincing of the world that Jesus is the Christ.
Anyone who will read the Book of Mormon and put it to the divine test that
Moroni proposes (see [Moro. 10:3-5](/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.3-5?lang=eng#2))
can be convinced that Jesus is the Christ. Once that conviction is gained,
then comes the question "Will we choose to follow Him?" The devils believe
that Jesus is the Christ, but they choose to follow Lucifer. (See [James
2:19](/scriptures/nt/james/2.19?lang=eng#18); [Mark
5:7](/scriptures/nt/mark/5.7?lang=eng#6).)

Throughout the ages prophets have exhorted the people to make up their minds.
"Choose you this day whom ye will serve," pled Joshua ([Josh.
24:15](/scriptures/ot/josh/24.15?lang=eng#14).)

Elijah thundered, "How long halt ye between two opinions? if the Lord be God,
follow him." ([1 Kgs. 18:21](/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/18.21?lang=eng#20).)

When you choose to follow Christ, you choose the Way, the Truth, the Life--the
right way, the saving truth, the abundant life. (See [John
14:6](/scriptures/nt/john/14.6?lang=eng#5).)

"I would commend you to seek this Jesus," states Moroni. ([Ether
12:41](/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.41?lang=eng#40).)

When you choose to follow Christ, you choose to be changed.

"No man," said President David O. McKay, "can sincerely resolve to apply in
his daily life the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth without sensing a change in
his own nature. The phrase 'born again' has a deeper significance than many
people attach to it. This _changed feeling_ may be indescribable, _but it is
real._" (In Conference Report, Apr. 1962, p. 7.)

Can human hearts be changed? Why, of course! It happens every day in the great
missionary work of the Church. It is one of the most widespread of Christ's
modern miracles. If it hasn't happened to you--it should.

Our Lord told Nicodemus that "except a man be born again, he cannot see the
kingdom of God." ([John 3:3](/scriptures/nt/john/3.3?lang=eng#2).) Of these
words President Kimball said, "This is the simple total answer to the
weightiest of all questions. ... To gain eternal life there must be a rebirth, a
transformation." (In Conference Report, Apr. 1958, p. 14.)

President McKay said that Christ called for "an entire revolution" of
Nicodemus's "inner man." "His manner of thinking, feeling, and acting with
reference to spiritual things would have to undergo a fundamental and
permanent change." (In Conference Report, Apr. 1960, p. 26.)

Besides the physical ordinance of baptism and the laying on of hands, one must
be spiritually born again to gain exaltation and eternal life.

Alma states: "And the Lord said unto me; Marvel not that all mankind, yea, men
and women, all nations, kindreds, tongues and people, must be born again; yea,
born of God, changed from their carnal and fallen state, to a state of
righteousness, being redeemed of God, becoming his sons and daughters;

"And thus they become new creatures; and unless they do this, they can in
nowise inherit the kingdom of God." ([Mosiah
27:25-26](/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/27.25-26?lang=eng#24).)

The "change of heart" and "born again" processes are best described in the
keystone of our religion, the Book of Mormon.

Those who had been born of God after hearing King Benjamin's address had a
mighty change in their hearts. They had "no more disposition to do evil, but
to do good continually." (See [Mosiah 5:2,
7](/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5.2,7?lang=eng#1).)

The fourth chapter of Alma describes a period in Nephite history when "the
church began to fail in its progress." ([Alma
4:10](/scriptures/bofm/alma/4.10?lang=eng#9).) Alma met this challenge by
resigning his seat as chief judge in government "and confined himself wholly
to the high priesthood" responsibility which was his. ([Alma
4:20](/scriptures/bofm/alma/4.20?lang=eng#19).)

He bore "down in pure testimony" against the people (see [Alma
4:19](/scriptures/bofm/alma/4.19?lang=eng#18)), and in the fifth chapter of
Alma he asks over forty crucial questions.

Speaking frankly to the members of the Church, he declared, "I ask of you, my
brethren of the church, have ye spiritually been born of God? Have ye received
his image in your countenances? Have ye experienced this mighty change in your
hearts?" ([Alma 5:14](/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.14?lang=eng#13).)

He continued, "If ye have experienced a change of heart, and if ye have felt
to sing the song of redeeming love, I would ask, can ye feel so now?" ([Alma
5:26](/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.26?lang=eng#25).)

Would not the progress of the Church increase dramatically today with an
increasing number of those who are spiritually reborn? Can you imagine what
would happen in our homes? Can you imagine what would happen with an
increasing number of copies of the Book of Mormon in the hands of an
increasing number of missionaries who know how to use it and who have been
born of God? When this happens, we will get the harvest President Kimball
envisions. It was the "born of God" Alma who as a missionary was so able to
impart the word that many others were also born of God. (See [Alma
36:23-26](/scriptures/bofm/alma/36.23-26?lang=eng#22).)

The Lord works from the inside out. The world works from the outside in. The
world would take people out of the slums. Christ takes the slums out of
people, and then they take themselves out of the slums. The world would mold
men by changing their environment. Christ changes men, who then change their
environment. The world would shape human behavior, but Christ can change human
nature.

"Human nature _can_ be changed, here and now," said President McKay, and then
he quoted the following:

"'You can change human nature. No man who has felt in him the Spirit of Christ
even for half a minute can deny this truth. ...

"'You do change human nature, your own human nature, if you surrender it to
Christ. Human nature can be changed here and now. Human nature has been
changed in the past. Human nature must be changed on an enormous scale in the
future, unless the world is to be drowned in its own blood. And only Christ
can change it.

"'Twelve men did quite a lot to change the world [nineteen hundred] years ago.
Twelve simple men.'" (Quoting Beverly Nichols, in _Stepping Stones to an
Abundant Life,_ comp. Llewelyn R. McKay, Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1971,
pp. 23, 127.)

Yes, Christ changes men, and changed men can change the world.

Men changed for Christ will be captained by Christ. Like Paul they will be
asking, "Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?" ([Acts
9:6](/scriptures/nt/acts/9.6?lang=eng#5).) Peter stated, they will "follow his
steps." ([1 Pet. 2:21](/scriptures/nt/1-pet/2.21?lang=eng#20).) John said they
will "walk, even as he walked." ([1 Jn.
2:6](/scriptures/nt/1-jn/2.6?lang=eng#5).)

Finally, men captained by Christ will be consumed in Christ. To paraphrase
President Harold B. Lee, they set fire in others because they are on fire.
(_Stand Ye in Holy Places,_ Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1974, p. 192.)

Their will is swallowed up in His will. (See [John
5:30](/scriptures/nt/john/5.30?lang=eng#29).)

They do always those things that please the Lord. (See [John
8:29](/scriptures/nt/john/8.29?lang=eng#28).)

Not only would they die for the Lord, but more important they want to live for
Him.

Enter their homes, and the pictures on their walls, the books on their
shelves, the music in the air, their words and acts reveal them as Christians.

They stand as witnesses of God at all times, and in all things, and in all
places. (See [Mosiah 18:9](/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.9?lang=eng#8).)

They have Christ on their minds, as they look unto Him in every thought. (See
[D&amp;C 6:36](/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/6.36?lang=eng#35).)

They have Christ in their hearts as their affections are placed on Him
forever. (See [Alma 37:36](/scriptures/bofm/alma/37.36?lang=eng#35).)

Almost every week they partake of the sacrament and witness anew to their
Eternal Father that they are willing to take upon them the name of His Son,
always remember Him, and keep His commandments. (See [Moro.
4:3](/scriptures/bofm/moro/4.3?lang=eng#2).)

In Book of Mormon language, they "feast upon the words of Christ" ([2 Ne.
32:3](/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/32.3?lang=eng#2)), "talk of Christ" ([2 Ne.
25:26](/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.26?lang=eng#25)), "rejoice in Christ" ([2 Ne.
25:26](/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.26?lang=eng#25)), "are made alive in Christ"
([2 Ne. 25:25](/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.25?lang=eng#24)), and "glory in
[their] Jesus" ([2 Ne. 33:6](/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/33.6?lang=eng#5).)

In short, they lose themselves in the Lord, and find eternal life. (See [Luke
17:33](/scriptures/nt/luke/17.33?lang=eng#32).)

President David O. McKay tells of a singular event that happened to him. After
falling asleep, he said he "beheld in vision something infinitely sublime." He
saw a beautiful city, a great concourse of people dressed in white, and the
Savior.

"The city, I understood, was his. It was the City Eternal; and the people
following him were to abide there in peace and eternal happiness.

"But who were they?

"As if the Savior read my thoughts, he answered by pointing to a semicircle
that then appeared above them, and on which were written in gold the words:

"_These Are They Who Have Overcome the World--Who Have Truly Been Born Again!_

"When I awoke, it was breaking day." (_Cherished Experiences from the Writings
of President David O. McKay,_ comp. Clare Middlemiss, Salt Lake City: Deseret
Book Co., 1976, pp. 59-60.)

When we awake and are born of God, a new day will break and Zion will be
redeemed.

May we be convinced that Jesus is the Christ, choose to follow Him, be changed
for Him, captained by Him, consumed in Him, and born again I pray in the name
of Jesus Christ, amen.
