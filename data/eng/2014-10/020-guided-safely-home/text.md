# Guided Safely Home

Brethren, we are assembled as a mighty body of the priesthood, both here in
the Conference Center and in locations throughout the world. I am honored yet
humbled by the responsibility which is mine to address a few remarks to you. I
pray for the Spirit of the Lord to attend me as I do so.

Seventy-five years ago, on February 14, 1939, in Hamburg, Germany, a public
holiday was celebrated. Amid fervent speeches, cheering throngs, and the
playing of patriotic anthems, the new battleship _Bismarck_ was put to sea via
the River Elbe. This, the most powerful vessel afloat, was a breathtaking
spectacle of armor and machinery. Construction required more than 57,000
blueprints for the 380-millimeter, radar-controlled, double-gun turrets. The
vessel featured 28,000 miles (45,000 km) of electrical circuits. It weighed
over 35,000 tons, and armor plate provided maximum safety. Majestic in
appearance, gigantic in size, awesome in firepower, the mighty colossus was
considered unsinkable.

The _Bismarck_'s appointment with destiny came more than two years later, when
on May 24, 1941, the two most powerful warships in the British Navy, the
_Prince of Wales_ and the _Hood,_ engaged in battle the _Bismarck_ and the
German cruiser _Prinz Eugen._ Within five minutes the _Bismarck_ had sent to
the depths of the Atlantic the _Hood_ and all but three men of a crew of over
1,400. The other British battleship, the _Prince of Wales,_ had suffered heavy
damage and turned away.

Over the next three days the _Bismarck_ was engaged again and again by British
warships and aircraft. In all, the British concentrated the strength of five
battleships, two aircraft carriers, 11 cruisers, and 21 destroyers in an
effort to find and to sink the mighty _Bismarck._

During these battles, shell after shell inflicted only superficial damage on
the _Bismarck._ Was it unsinkable after all? Then a torpedo scored a lucky
hit, which jammed the _Bismarck_'s rudder. Repair efforts proved fruitless.
With guns primed and the crews at ready, the _Bismarck_ could only steer a
slow circle. Just beyond reach was the powerful German air force. The
_Bismarck_ could not reach the safety of home port. Neither could provide the
needed haven, for the _Bismarck_ had lost the ability to steer a charted
course. No rudder, no help, no port. The end drew near. British guns blazed as
the German crew scuttled and sank the once seemingly indestructible vessel.
The hungry waves of the Atlantic first lapped at the sides and then swallowed
the pride of the German navy. The _Bismarck_ was no more.[1]

Like the _Bismarck,_ each of us is a miracle of engineering. Our creation,
however, was not limited by human genius. Man can devise the most complex
machines but cannot give them life or bestow upon them the powers of reason
and judgment. These are divine gifts, bestowed only by God.

Like the vital rudder of a ship, brethren, we have been provided a way to
determine the direction we travel. The lighthouse of the Lord beckons to all
as we sail the seas of life. Our purpose is to steer an undeviating course
toward our desired goal--even the celestial kingdom of God. A man without a
purpose is like a ship without a rudder, never likely to reach home port. To
us comes the signal: chart your course, set your sail, position your rudder,
and proceed.

As with the mighty _Bismarck,_ so it is with man. The thrust of the turbines
and the power of the propellers are useless without that sense of direction,
that harnessing of the energy, that directing of the power provided by the
rudder, hidden from view, relatively small in size but absolutely essential in
function.

Our Father provided the sun, the moon, and the stars--heavenly galaxies to
guide mariners who sail the lanes of the sea. To us, as we walk the pathway of
life, He provides a clear map and points the way toward our desired
destination. He cautions: beware the detours, the pitfalls, the traps. We
cannot be deceived by those who would lead us astray, those clever pied pipers
of sin beckoning here or there. Instead, we pause to pray; we listen to that
still, small voice which speaks to the depths of our souls the Master's gentle
invitation, "Come, follow me."[2]

Yet there are those who do not hear, who will not obey, who prefer to walk a
path of their own making. Too often they succumb to the temptations which
surround all of us and which can appear so enticing.

As bearers of the priesthood, we have been placed on earth in troubled times.
We live in a complex world with currents of conflict everywhere to be found.
Political schemes ruin the stability of nations, despots grasp for power, and
segments of society seem forever downtrodden, deprived of opportunity and left
with a feeling of failure. The sophistries of men ring in our ears, and sin
surrounds us.

Ours is the responsibility to be worthy of all the glorious blessings our
Father in Heaven has in store for us. Wherever we go, our priesthood goes with
us. Are we standing in holy places? Please, before you put yourself and your
priesthood in jeopardy by venturing into places or participating in activities
which are not worthy of you or of that priesthood, pause to consider the
consequences.

We who have been ordained to the priesthood of God can make a difference. When
we maintain our personal purity and honor our priesthood, we become righteous
examples for others to follow. The Apostle Paul admonished, "Be thou an
example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in
faith, in purity."[3] He also wrote that the followers of Christ should be "as
lights in the world."[4] Providing an example of righteousness can help to
illuminate an increasingly dark world.

Many of you will remember President N. Eldon Tanner, who served as a counselor
to four Presidents of the Church. He provided an undeviating example of
righteousness throughout his career in industry, during service in the
government in Canada, and as an Apostle of Jesus Christ. He gave us this
inspired counsel: "Nothing will bring greater joy and success than to live
according to the teachings of the gospel. Be an example; be an influence for
good."

He continued: "Every one of us has been foreordained for some work as [God's]
chosen servant on whom he has seen fit to confer the priesthood and power to
act in his name. Always remember that people are looking to you for leadership
and you are influencing the lives of individuals either for good or for bad,
which influence will be felt for generations to come."[5]

We are strengthened by the truth that the greatest force in the world today is
the power of God as it works through man. To sail safely the seas of
mortality, we need the guidance of that Eternal Mariner--even the great
Jehovah. We reach out, we reach up to obtain heavenly help.

A well-known example of one who did not reach upward is that of Cain, son of
Adam and Eve. Powerful in potential but weak of will, Cain permitted greed,
envy, disobedience, and even murder to jam that personal rudder which would
have guided him to safety and exaltation. The downward gaze replaced the
upward look; Cain fell.

In another time and by a wicked king, a servant of God was tested. Aided by
the inspiration of heaven, Daniel interpreted for the king the writing on the
wall. Concerning the proffered rewards--even a royal robe, a necklace of gold,
and political power--Daniel said, "Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy
rewards to another."[6] Great riches and power had been offered to Daniel,
rewards representing the things of the world and not of God. Daniel resisted
and remained faithful.

Later, when Daniel worshipped God despite a decree declaring such to be
forbidden, he was thrown into a den of lions. The biblical account tells us
that the following morning, "Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner
of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in ... God."[7] In a time of
critical need, Daniel's determination to steer a steady course yielded divine
protection and provided a sanctuary of safety. Such protection and safety can
be ours as we also steer that steady course toward our eternal home.

The clock of history, like the sands of the hourglass, marks the passage of
time. A new cast occupies the stage of life. The problems of our day loom
ominously before us. Throughout the history of the world, Satan has worked
tirelessly for the destruction of the followers of the Savior. If we succumb
to his enticings, we--like the mighty _Bismarck_--will lose that rudder which
can guide us to safety. Instead, surrounded by the sophistication of modern
living, we look heavenward for that unfailing sense of direction, that we
might chart and follow a wise and proper course. Our Heavenly Father will not
leave our sincere petition unanswered. As we seek heavenly help, our rudder,
unlike that of the _Bismarck,_ will not fail.

As we venture forth on our individual voyages, may we sail safely the seas of
life. May we have the courage of a Daniel, that we might remain true and
faithful despite the sin and temptation which surround us. May our testimonies
be as deep and as strong as that of Jacob, the brother of Nephi, who, when
confronted by one who sought in every way possible to destroy his faith,
declared, "I could not be shaken."[8]

With the rudder of faith guiding our passage, brethren, we too will find our
way safely home--home to God, to dwell with Him eternally. That such may be so
for each of us, I pray in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, our Savior and
Redeemer, amen.
