# Born Again

My dear brothers, sisters, and friends, the responsibility of speaking to all
of you is a matter of great concern to me. I pray for your understanding.

My baptism into this Church was one of the highlights of my life. I was eight
years of age. My parents taught me and my brothers the significance of this
great ordinance. My mother told me that after my baptism I would be held
accountable for the things I did that were not right. I remember the day of my
baptism very vividly. I was baptized in the baptismal font in the Tabernacle
on Temple Square. Those who were being baptized put on white coveralls and one
by one were gently taken down the steps into the water. One of the children
baptized that day was not totally immersed, and so the ordinance was repeated.
This was necessary because, as the scriptures indicate, "baptism symbolizes
death, burial, and resurrection, and can only be done by immersion."[1] It
also follows the pattern set by the Savior, who was baptized in the river
Jordan, where there was much water. As Matthew records, "And Jesus, when he
was baptized, went up straightway out of the water."[2]

Even though I was only eight years of age, the words of the baptismal prayer
penetrated deeply into my soul. After repeating my name, Brother Irvin G.
Derrick, who baptized me, said, "Having been commissioned of Jesus Christ, I
baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.
Amen."[3]

Since I was baptized, over 11 million people have been baptized into The
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in a similar manner and by the
same authority. They have been baptized in frozen lakes, the ocean, or ponds,
some of which were dug for that purpose. One such pond has great historic
significance. In 1840 Wilford Woodruff, then one of the Twelve Apostles, was
serving a mission in England and felt impressed to go to a rural district near
Ledbury. There he met John Benbow, who had a large farm and a small pond. John
introduced him to a congregation of United Brethren who were eager to hear the
gospel message. He later recorded in his journal that with no other help at
hand on March 7, 1840, "I spent most of the ... day in clearing out a pool of
water and preparing it for baptizing, as I saw that many would receive that
ordinance. I afterwards baptized six hundred persons in that pool of
water."[4]

The Savior taught us that all men and women must be born again. Nicodemus, one
of the rulers among the Jews, came surreptitiously to the Savior by night and
said, "Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do
these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.

"Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a
man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God."[5]

Nicodemus was bewildered and asked: "How can a man be born when he is old? can
he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?"

Jesus explained that He was talking about being born spiritually. He said:

"Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the
Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.

"That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the
Spirit is spirit."[6]

All of us need to be born spiritually, from 8 to 80--or even 90. When Sister
Luise Wulff of the German Democratic Republic was baptized in 1989, she
exclaimed, "There I was--ninety-four years old and born again!"[7] Our first
birth takes place when we are born into mortality. Our second birth begins
when we are baptized by water by one holding the priesthood of God and is
completed when we are confirmed, and "then cometh a remission of [our] sins by
fire and by the Holy Ghost."[8]

Some years ago Albert Peters told of the experience he and his companion had
of a man being born again. One day they went to the hut of Atiati in the
village of Sasina in Samoa. There they found an unshaven, unkempt, misshapen
man lying on a bed. He asked them to come in and introduce themselves. He was
pleased to know they were missionaries and wanted to hear their message. They
presented the first discussion, bore witness to him, and then left. As they
walked away, they discussed Atiati's condition; he had had polio 22 years
before that had left him without the use of his arms or legs, so how could he
ever be baptized, being so completely disabled?

When they visited their new friend the next day, they were unprepared for the
change in Atiati. He was bright and clean-shaven; even his bedding had been
changed. "Today," he said, "I begin to live again, because yesterday my
prayers were answered and you [came] to me. ... I have waited for more than
twenty years for someone to come and tell me that they have the true gospel of
Christ."

For several weeks the two missionaries taught this sincere, intelligent man
the principles of the gospel, and he received a strong witness of the truth
and the need for baptism. He asked them to fast with him so that he would have
the strength to go down into the water and be baptized. The nearest baptismal
font was eight miles away. So they carried him to their car, drove him to the
chapel, and set him on a bench. Their district leader opened the service by
bearing a strong testimony about the sacred ordinance of baptism. Then Elder
Peters and his companion picked up Atiati and carried him to the font. As they
did so, Atiati said, "Please, put me down." They hesitated, and he said again,
"Put me down."

As they stood in some confusion, Atiati smiled and exclaimed: "This is the
most important event in my life. I know without a doubt in my mind that this
is the only way to eternal salvation. _I will not be carried to my
salvation!_" So they lowered Atiati to the ground. After a huge effort, he
managed to pull himself up. The man who had lain 20 years without moving was
now standing. Slowly, one shaky step at a time, Atiati went down the steps and
into the water, where the astonished missionary took him by the hand and
baptized him. He then asked to be carried from the font to the chapel, where
he was confirmed a member of the Church.

Atiati continued to progress so that he gained the ability to walk only by a
cane. He told Elder Peters that he knew that he would be able to walk on the
morning of his baptism. He said, "Since faith can move a stubborn mountain, I
had no doubt in my mind that it would mend these limbs of mine."[9] I believe
we can say that Atiati was truly born again!

Like Atiati, when we are baptized, we are spiritually born of God and are
entitled to receive His image in our countenances.[10] We should experience a
mighty change of heart[11] so that we can "become new creatures"[12] and
exercise faith in the redemption of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, in
order to maintain our standards of worthiness. The personal standards of
worthiness to be baptized into this Church are plain:

"All those who humble themselves before God, and desire to be baptized, and
come forth with broken hearts and contrite spirits, and witness before the
church that they have truly repented of all their sins, and are willing to
take upon them the name of Jesus Christ, having a determination to serve him
to the end, and truly manifest by their works that they have received of the
Spirit of Christ unto the remission of their sins, shall be received by
baptism into his church."[13]

Baptism by immersion in water is "the introductory ordinance of the gospel,
and must be followed by baptism of the Spirit in order to be complete."[14] As
the Prophet Joseph Smith once said: "You might as well baptize a bag of sand
as a man, if not done in view of the remission of sins and getting of the Holy
Ghost. Baptism by water is but half a baptism, and is good for nothing without
the other half--that is, the baptism of the Holy Ghost."[15]

The full benefit of forgiveness of sin through the Savior's Atonement begins
with repentance and baptism and then expands upon receiving the Holy Ghost. As
Nephi said, baptism is the gate, "and then cometh a remission of your sins by
fire and by the Holy Ghost."[16] The baptismal gate opens the way for
additional covenants and blessings through priesthood and temple blessings.

The transcendent gift of the Holy Ghost, along with membership in The Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is bestowed by confirmation, by the
laying on of hands by those having priesthood authority. This was made clear
by Paul to the Ephesians when he asked: "Have ye received the Holy Ghost since
ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether
there be any Holy Ghost.

"And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto
John's baptism.

"Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying
unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him,
that is, on Christ Jesus.

"When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.

"And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them."[17]

If worthy, those possessing this spiritual gift can come to enjoy greater
understanding and enrichment and guidance in all of life's activities, both
spiritual and temporal. The Holy Ghost bears witness to us of the truth and
impresses upon our souls the reality of God the Father and His Son, Jesus
Christ, so surely that no earthly power or authority can separate us from that
knowledge.[18] Indeed, not having the gift of the Holy Ghost is somewhat like
having a body without an immune system.

We believe the Spirit of Christ comes to all men and women.[19] This is
distinct from the gift of the Holy Ghost.

The Prophet Joseph Smith taught, "There is a difference between the Holy Ghost
and the gift of the Holy Ghost."[20] Many outside the Church have received
revelation by the power of the Holy Ghost, convincing them of the truth of the
gospel. Through this power sincere investigators acquire a testimony of the
Book of Mormon and the principles of the gospel before baptism. However,
administrations of the Holy Ghost are limited without receiving the gift of
the Holy Ghost.

Those who possess the gift of the Holy Ghost after baptism and confirmation
can receive more light and testimony. This is because the gift of the Holy
Ghost is "a permanent witness and higher endowment than the ordinary
manifestation of the Holy Spirit."[21] It is the higher endowment because the
gift of the Holy Ghost can act as "a cleansing agent to purify a person and
sanctify him from all sin."[22]

Because baptism by water and of the Spirit is essential for full salvation, in
the eternal nature of things all of God's children should have this
opportunity, including those who have lived in centuries past. The doctrine of
baptism of the living for the dead in the temple was understood and practiced
in the early Christian church. Paul, in his great discussion about the
Resurrection, reasoned: "Else what shall they do which are baptized for the
dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the
dead?"[23] Doing something so vital for those who cannot do it for themselves
is truly Christlike. By laying down His life to atone for the sins of all
mankind, Jesus did that for us which we cannot do for ourselves. The prophet
Malachi referenced this concept when he spoke of the coming of the prophet
Elijah, who would "turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the
heart of the children to their fathers, lest [the Lord] come and smite the
earth with a curse."[24] This is accomplished in large measure through
vicarious work for the dead.

No other organization on the earth is doing more to fulfil Malachi's promise
than the Church. At great expense and effort the Church is now the custodian
of the greatest treasure of family records in the world. The Church now has
660 million names on the FamilySearch™ Internet Web site.[25] These records
are freely shared with anyone who wishes to research them.

As I have lived so many years since my baptism by water, I have come to savor
the spiritual gifts of the Holy Ghost that come through baptism of the Spirit.
I was confirmed 72 years ago by one having authority, Joseph A. F. Everett, a
close friend of my parents and a very noble man.

I humbly pray that the Spirit of the Lord will put His seal upon the
importance of the things about which I have spoken. I witness that we cannot
be fully converted until we "walk in newness of life"[26] and are at heart a
new person, "purged from [our] old sins."[27] This can only come about by
being born again of the water and of the Spirit through baptism and receiving
the gift of the Holy Ghost. In this way we receive divine forgiveness, by
which we can know in our hearts that our sins are remitted.[28] I know this to
be true and so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
