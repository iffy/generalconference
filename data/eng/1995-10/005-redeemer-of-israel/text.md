# Redeemer of Israel

The parable of the prodigal son is a parable of us all. It reminds us that we
are, in some measure, prodigal sons and daughters of our Father in Heaven.
For, as the Apostle Paul wrote, "all have sinned, and come short of the glory
of God" ([Rom. 3:23](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/rom/3.23?lang=eng#22)).

Like the errant son of the Savior's parable, we have come to "a far country"
([Luke 15:13](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/15.13?lang=eng#12))
separated from our premortal home. Like the prodigal, we share in a divine
inheritance, but by our sins we squander a portion thereof and experience a
"mighty famine" ([Luke
15:14](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/15.14?lang=eng#13)) of spirit.
Like him, we learn through painful experience that worldly pleasures and
pursuits are of no more worth than the husks of corn that swine eat. We yearn
to be reconciled with our Father and return to his home.

_How long we have wandered_

_As strangers in sin,_

_And cried in the desert for thee!_

In the parable of the prodigal son, only the eldest son remains true to his
father; in his own words, "Neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment"
([Luke 15:29](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/15.29?lang=eng#28)).
Similarly, in the plan of salvation, the Firstborn of the Father is sinless
and without spot. Yet there is a vital difference. In the parable, the eldest
son is jealous of the attention paid to the returning prodigal. In the plan of
salvation, however, the eldest son _makes possible_ the return of the
prodigals.

The Father sends him forth to redeem his sons and daughters from bondage. The
eldest is filled with compassion. "I will save them out of all their
dwellingplaces, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them" ([Ezek.
37:23](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/ezek/37.23?lang=eng#22)). He journeys
the long distance to find and bring home the prodigal ones. And there he finds
us weary, hungry, and downtrodden. He feeds us and gives us drink. He lives
among us and shares our burdens. Then, in a final act of supreme love, the
eldest son takes of his own wealth and, one by one, he ransoms us. In order to
pay the fulness of our debt, he is compelled to sacrifice his own fortune,
yea, all that he has, every whit.

There are those who refuse the proffered ransom. Chained by pride, they prefer
bondage to repentance. But those who accept of his offering and forsake their
errant ways receive healing at his hands and liberty as his gift. These he
leads back to the Father with songs of everlasting joy.

I testify that the eldest son of our Father in Heaven did redeem us from the
bondage of sin. We are a purchased people. In the words of Paul, "Ye are
bought with a price" ([1 Cor.
7:23](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-cor/7.23?lang=eng#22)). In the
Garden of Gethsemane, the Firstborn of the Father "descended below all things"
([D&amp;C 88:6](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-
testament/dc/88.6?lang=eng#5)); he bore "our griefs, and carried our sorrows"
([Isa. 53:4](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/isa/53.4?lang=eng#3)). At
Golgotha, at the hands of men for whose very sins he had atoned, "he ... poured
out his soul unto death" ([Isa.
53:12](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/isa/53.12?lang=eng#11)), freely
relinquishing his life as he overcame the world.

In the premortal realm, he had been the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the
Creator of the earth, the great I AM. From these exalted heights, he
descended, coming to earth in the most humble of circumstances that he might
be no stranger to our sorrows. Instead of worldly station, he chose to be born
in a lowly stable and live the simple life of a carpenter. He grew up in an
obscure village in a despised precinct of Palestine. He made himself of no
reputation, and was "a root out of a dry ground," having "no beauty that we
should desire him" ([Isa.
53:2](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/isa/53.2?lang=eng#1)).

He might have had political power and honor; he chose instead to be a healer
and a teacher. He might have won the favor of his people by freeing them from
Roman oppression; instead, he saved them from their sins and was rejected by
his own. He sacrificed the glory of Galilee to experience the humiliation and
trial of Jerusalem. Then, in a most literal way, the Lord Jesus Christ paid
the utmost demands of our ransom, as he bore "the pain of all men" ([D&amp;C
18:11](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/18.11?lang=eng#10)).

"And the world, because of their iniquity, shall judge him to be a thing of
naught; wherefore they scourge him, and he suffereth it; and they smite him,
and he suffereth it. Yea, they spit upon him, and he suffereth it, because of
his loving kindness and his long-suffering towards the children of men" ([1
Ne. 19:9](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/19.9?lang=eng#8)).

A few years ago I visited Jerusalem shortly before Christmas. The streets were
cold and dreary; there was political tension in the air. Yet peace filled my
heart to know that this was the city he loved so much, the very place of his
eternal sacrifice; to know that here had lived he who was the Savior of all
mankind.

I returned to the United States late on a Saturday evening. When the Sabbath
dawned, my alarm awoke me to these words from "O Holy Night":

_The King of kings lay thus in lowly manger,_

_In all our trials born to be our friend._

And I began to weep as I contemplated the perfect life and glorious sacrifice
of the Redeemer of Israel--he who was born the friend of the lowly and hope of
the meek.

I bear testimony that the Lord Jesus Christ has paid the price of our sins,
upon condition of repentance. He is the Firstborn of the Father. He is the
Holy One of Israel. He is the first fruits of the Resurrection. I testify that
he lives. I testify that he is in very deed, "our only delight, ... our King,
our Deliv'rer, our all!" (_Hymns,_ 1985, no. 6.) In the name of Jesus Christ,
amen.
