# A Teacher

Observing the clock, I fold the notes that I have prepared and place them in
my inside pocket. But let me take just a moment to mention a little incident
that made an impression upon me when I was a boy. This came to my mind when it
was mentioned that there are with us this afternoon a large group of dedicated
people who teach our youth.

It was on a summer day early in the morning. I was standing near the window.
The curtains obstructed me from two little creatures out on the lawn. One was
a large bird and the other a little bird, obviously just out of the nest. I
saw the larger bird hop out on the lawn, then thump his feet and cock his
head. He drew a big fat worm out of the lawn and came hopping back. The little
bird opened its bill wide, but the big bird swallowed the worm.

Then I saw the big bird fly up into a tree. He pecked at the bark for a little
while and came back with a big bug in his mouth. The little bird opened his
beak wide, but the big bird swallowed the bug. There was squawking in protest.

The big bird flew away, and I didn't see it again, but I watched the little
bird. After a while, the little bird hopped out on the lawn, thumped its feet,
cocked its head, and pulled a big worm out of the lawn.

God bless the good people who teach our children and our youth, I humbly pray,
in Jesus' name. Amen.
