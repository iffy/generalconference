# Three Days in the Tomb

Last spring my wife and I had the wonderful privilege of visiting the Holy
Land. On the last day of our stay in Jerusalem, we left the hotel early in the
morning and walked to the Garden Tomb. To our great delight, we were alone in
the garden. A feeling of awesome reverence filled our hearts. We gazed at the
hill Golgotha, the place of the skull. We could imagine the three crosses
there and the sign "This is Jesus--the King of the Jews" over the agonized
figure of Christ. (See [Matt. 27:37](/scriptures/nt/matt/27.37?lang=eng#36).)
The thought comes, "Are we worth all his suffering for us?"

Then we turned to the tomb--historically the property of Joseph of Arimathaea.
Here Joseph and Nicodemus placed him, assisted by the women. His disciples had
left him. The stone was rolled to cover the door, and everyone departed--all
but Mary Magdalene and the other Mary. (See [Matt.
27:60-61](/scriptures/nt/matt/27.60-61?lang=eng#59).) They sat huddled next to
the sepulcher. Then a watch was placed at the tomb.

We are told there was great destruction in Jerusalem; the veil of the temple
was "rent in twain." ([Matt. 27:51](/scriptures/nt/matt/27.51?lang=eng#50).)
The destruction was much greater, however, on this continent. There were great
convulsions of the earth. In three hours cities were destroyed, some buried,
some burnt. Mountains appeared where cities had been. There was storm, then
tempest, and a great dense darkness covered the entire land. At the conclusion
of three hours of destruction, yet during the darkness, which lasted three
days, a voice, only a voice, came to them. The voice identified itself as that
of Jesus Christ, saying:

"Behold, I am Jesus Christ the Son of God. I created the heavens and the
earth, and all things that in them are. I was with the Father from the
beginning. I am in the Father, and the Father in me; and in me hath the Father
glorified his name.

"I came unto my own, and my own received me not. And the scriptures concerning
my coming are fulfilled." ([3 Ne.
9:15-16](/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9.15-16?lang=eng#14).)

He told them the destruction had been because of their wickedness, and that
only the more righteous had been spared. Possibly preparing them for his visit
after his resurrection, he told them to repent and he would receive them.

The voice told them that the Law of Moses had been fulfilled by him. "And ye
shall offer up unto me no more the shedding of blood; yea, your sacrifices and
your burnt offerings shall be done away, for I will accept none of your
sacrifices and your burnt offerings.

"And ye shall offer for a sacrifice unto me a broken heart and a contrite
spirit. ..." ([3 Ne. 9:19-20](/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9.19-20?lang=eng#18).)

On two separate occasions during his ministry he had said, "... I will have
mercy, and not sacrifice. ..." ([Matt.
9:13](/scriptures/nt/matt/9.13?lang=eng#12) and [Matt.
12:7](/scriptures/nt/matt/12.7?lang=eng#6).)

Another main activity, while his body lay in the tomb, was to visit the
spirits of those who had died. He said on one occasion, "Verily, verily, I say
unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice
of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live." ([John
5:25](/scriptures/nt/john/5.25?lang=eng#24).)

While on the cross, to the condemned, believing thief, he said, "... Verily I
say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise." ([Luke
23:43](/scriptures/nt/luke/23.43?lang=eng#42).)

Peter tells us, "For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the
unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but
quickened by the Spirit:

"By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;

"Which sometime were disobedient, when once the long-suffering of God waited
in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is,
eight souls were saved by water." ([1 Pet.
3:18-20](/scriptures/nt/1-pet/3.18-20?lang=eng#17).)

This is a great principle of the gospel. This gives all mankind an opportunity
to hear and receive the gospel, and to make further progress after death.

Peter also tells us that, "for this cause was the gospel preached also to them
that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but
live according to God in the spirit." ([1 Pet.
4:6](/scriptures/nt/1-pet/4.6?lang=eng#5).)

So two great and marvelous things transpired while the body of Christ lay in
the tomb. One, his voice was heard by the people on this continent preaching
to them, declaring that sacrifices are no longer accepted. Remember, he was
not yet resurrected. He returned after his resurrection and showed himself and
taught the people. Two, he preached to the spirits in prison.

On the third day, an angel came and rolled away the stone that closed the
tomb. While walking in the garden that morning, my wife and I could easily
visualize the stone that was placed there. The entrance to the tomb was cut
into a perpendicular face of the hill. There was a small door, in front of
which was a trough in which the stone would fit to be rolled into position to
close or cover the door.

We remembered how Mary Magdalene and the other women had come early in the
morning of the first day of the week with spices to prepare the body and found
the stone rolled away. As they looked in, an angel told them He had risen. He
told them to go to the disciples and tell them He had risen.

Mary found and told Peter and John. They came running. John, the younger,
arrived first, looked into the tomb, but did not enter until after Peter had
entered. The body was gone, but the linens were there, neatly folded. John and
Peter then returned to their home. "For as yet they knew not the scripture,
that he must rise again from the dead." ([John
20:9](/scriptures/nt/john/20.9?lang=eng#8).)

"But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she stooped
down, and looked into the sepulchre,

"And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at
the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.

"And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because
they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.

"And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing,
and knew not that it was Jesus.

"Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She,
supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him
hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away." In a voice
so familiar to her she could not mistake it, "Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She
turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master.

"Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father:
but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your
Father; and to my God, and your God." ([John
20:11-17](/scriptures/nt/john/20.11-17?lang=eng#10).)

The other women who had come to the sepulcher had been told by the angel to go
tell the disciples that He had risen. Jesus met them on their way, "saying,
All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him." ([Matt.
28:9](/scriptures/nt/matt/28.9?lang=eng#8).)

They, too, were instructed to go tell his brethren.

He appeared to all the disciples except Thomas and Judas, who had hanged
himself. Later he appeared to all the disciples including Thomas.

"Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed:
blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed." ([John
20:29](/scriptures/nt/john/20.29?lang=eng#28).)

He not only appeared to his disciples on several occasions and to 500 in
Galilee, he also appeared to those on _this_ continent. The Book of Mormon
gives us this account.

As we wandered in the garden, Jeanne and I were alone. We walked into the
tomb. There we witnessed a spirit of peace, as he had said, "Peace I leave
with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you.
Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid." ([John
14:27](/scriptures/nt/john/14.27?lang=eng#26).)

We received a witness there, and then, as he said to Martha, "... I am the
resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet
shall he live." ([John 11:25](/scriptures/nt/john/11.25?lang=eng#24).)

Through his resurrection, eternal progress for all mankind has been made
possible. He opened the way that we may go on and on and on forever.

I had the same feeling come over me when I first visited the Sacred Grove in
western New York. As I walked into that grove early one morning all alone, the
witness came to me that truly the Father and the Son did appear to the boy
Joseph Smith just as Christ had appeared to Mary in the garden.

Truly he lives and has again established his kingdom upon the earth to prepare
for his coming in glory to reign upon the earth.

May God give us knowledge and understanding to know his will and give us the
desire and strength to abide by his teachings, I pray in the name of Jesus
Christ. Amen.
