# The Father and the Son

My beloved brothers and sisters, I am grateful to address you this afternoon
in the setting of this inspiring general conference!

In addressing a topic that to my mind is most sacred, I wish first to
acknowledge with gratitude the devotion of so many Christians throughout the
ages, including my ancestry of French Protestants and Irish Catholics. Because
of their faith and worship of God, many of them sacrificed position,
possessions, and even their lives in defense of their God and their faith.[1]

As Latter-day Saints and as Christians, we likewise have a strong and deep
faith in God the Eternal Father and His Son, Jesus Christ. Devotion to God
ever remains a sacred and personal matter between each of us and our Maker.

Our quest for eternal life is nothing other than a quest to understand who God
is and for us to return to live with Him. The Savior prayed to His Father,
"And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and
Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent."[2]

Even in the light of this declaration by our Savior Himself, the prevailing
view of the nature of the Father and the Son throughout the many centuries and
among much of mankind is clearly inconsistent with the teachings of the holy
scriptures.

We respectfully submit that at the heart of the gospel of Jesus Christ and its
power to save is a correct understanding of the Father and the Son.[3]

The importance of this most fundamental principle of the gospel of Jesus
Christ is confirmed by the First Vision of the Prophet Joseph Smith in 1820.
The Prophet wrote: "I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all
description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling
me by name and said, pointing to the other--_This is My Beloved Son. Hear
Him!_"[4]

This experience by the boy Joseph, followed by many other visions and
revelations, reveals that God actually exists; the Father and His Son, Jesus
Christ, are two separate and distinct beings; man is created in the image of
God; our Heavenly Father is literally the Father of Jesus Christ; God
continues to reveal Himself to man; God is ever near and interested in us; and
He answers our prayers.

Even though similar appearances of the Father and the Son in holy writ are
relatively rare, the remarkable fact of the First Vision is that it agrees so
well with other recorded events in the holy scriptures.

In the New Testament, for example, we read of Stephen's final testimony at his
martyrdom. Said he, "Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man
standing on the right hand of God."[5]

While in mighty vision on the Isle of Patmos, the Apostle John sees the "Lord
God Almighty"[6] as well as the Lamb of God, who "redeemed us ... by [His]
blood."[7]

In the Book of Mormon, the doctrine of the Father and the Son stands in
majestic testimony alongside the Holy Bible. The Book of Mormon records the
visitation of our Savior to the Nephites, in which the voice of the Father, in
the presence of some 2,500 Nephites, introduces the risen Christ: "Behold my
Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, in whom I have glorified my name--hear
ye him."[8]

In the four Gospels, Christ Himself refers to His Father in Heaven 160 times,
while during His brief three-day ministry among the Nephites, as recorded in
the Book of Mormon, He mentions His Father 122 times.

For example, in Matthew, Jesus says, "Not every one that saith unto me, Lord,
Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of
_my Father_ which is in heaven."[9]

In John, He testifies, "The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth
_the Father_ do."[10]

And in Luke, He exclaims, "_Father,_ into thy hands I commend my spirit."[11]

Every time our Lord refers to His Heavenly Father, He does so with the utmost
reverence and submissiveness.

In saying this, I hope there will be no misunderstanding. Jesus Christ is the
great Jehovah, the God of Israel, the promised Messiah, and because of His
infinite Atonement, He is our Savior and the Redeemer of the world. Of Him the
Apostle Paul declared, "Then cometh the end, when [Christ] shall have
delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when [Christ] shall have put
down all rule and all authority and power."[12]

On the eve of the Savior's Atonement, He offered up His great Intercessory
Prayer to His Father. He prayed:

"Neither pray I for these [in other words, His Apostles] alone, but for them
also which shall believe on me through their word;

"That they all may be _one;_ as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that
they also may be _one in us:_ that the world may believe that thou hast sent
me.

"And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one,
even as we are one."[13]

The Father and the Son are distinctly separate beings, but They are perfectly
united and one in power and purpose. Their oneness is not reserved for Them
alone; rather, They desire this same oneness for everyone who will, with
devotion, follow and obey Their commandments.

How is the earnest seeker of God able to become acquainted with the Father and
the Son? Our Savior promised, "But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, ...
shall teach you all things."[14]

In the Book of Mormon, Nephi, when speaking of the doctrine of Christ,
declared that the Holy Ghost "witnesses of the Father and the Son."[15]

It is true that the power or influence of the Holy Ghost may on occasion be
felt, according to the will of the Lord, by any person irrespective of that
person's religious persuasion. But the full measure, or gift, of the Holy
Ghost comes only after a person has received, with "a broken heart and a
contrite spirit,"[16] the ordinances of baptism and the gift of the Holy
Ghost[17] by the laying on of hands. These and other sacred ordinances may be
performed only under the direction and power of the priesthood of God. In this
regard, we are taught:

"And this greater priesthood administereth the gospel and holdeth the key of
the mysteries of the kingdom, even the key of the knowledge of God.

"Therefore, in the ordinances thereof, the power of godliness is
manifest."[18]

Seen in its true light, the doctrine of the Father and the Son is the doctrine
of the eternal family. Every human being has existed previously as a spirit
child with heavenly parents,[19] with Christ being the Firstborn of the Father
in this heavenly family.[20]

So it is with all of us. We are the children of our Heavenly Father.

President Ezra Taft Benson with prophetic insight said, "Nothing is going to
startle us more when we pass through the veil to the other side than to
realize how well we know our Father [in Heaven] and how familiar his face is
to us."[21]

I have learned that it is not possible to convey in the language of man those
things which are made known only by the Holy Ghost and power of God. It is in
this spirit that I bear my solemn witness and testimony of the reality,
nearness, and goodness of our Eternal Father and His holy Son, Jesus Christ.
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
