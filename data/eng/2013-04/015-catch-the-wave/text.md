# Catch the Wave

Dear brothers and sisters, I add my voice to that of President Thomas S.
Monson and others in praising those who have responded to a prophet's call for
more worthy missionaries. Now an unprecedented wave of enthusiasm for
missionary work is sweeping the entire earth. Since President Monson's
historic announcement last October, thousands of elders, sisters, and couples
have been called, and many more are preparing.[1] Now we get questions like
"What are you going to do with all these missionaries?" The answer is simple.
They will do what missionaries have always done. They will preach the gospel!
They will bless the children of Almighty God!

More of you young men and women will catch this wave as you strive to be
worthy of mission calls. You see this as a wave of truth and righteousness.
You see your opportunity to be on the crest of that wave.

You teenagers, embrace your new curriculum and teach one another the doctrine
of Jesus Christ. Now is your time to prepare to teach others about the
goodness of God.

Young men and women, your education is ever important--to us, to you, and to
God. Where feasible, if you wish to attend a college or university _after_
your mission, we encourage you to apply to your institution of choice _before_
beginning your mission. Many institutions of higher learning will grant an 18-
to 30-month deferral to prospective missionaries. This will enable you elders
and sisters to serve without worrying about where you will begin your advanced
education. We are very grateful to leaders of educational institutions who are
making such planning possible!

You parents, teachers, and others, catch the wave as you prepare our rising
generation to be worthy of missionary service. Meanwhile, your exemplary lives
will attract the interest of your friends and neighbors. Be ready to give an
answer to those who ask why you live as you do. Be ready to give a reason for
the hope and joy that they see in you.[2] When such questions come, you might
respond by saying, "Let's ask the missionaries! They can help us! And if you
desire, I will be at your side as the missionaries respond and teach you."

You adults, catch the wave with help for the spiritual, physical, and
financial preparation of future missionaries. Pinching pennies for piggy banks
becomes part of your practice. You senior couples, you plan for the day when
you can go on your mission. We will be most grateful for your service. Until
then, perhaps some of you could send your dollars on missions by contributing
to the General Missionary Fund, as suggested by President Monson again this
morning.[3]

Increasing numbers of selected men and their dear companions catch the wave as
they are called to preside over missions of the Church. In that service they
will shape the destiny of generations born and unborn. Mission presidents hold
keys of responsibility for the welfare, safety, and success of their
missionaries. After consulting with stake and district presidents in his
mission, each mission president assigns missionaries to serve in specific
stakes, wards, and branches.

Stake presidents and bishops catch the wave as they spend more and more hours
interviewing prospective missionaries. These priesthood leaders hold keys of
responsibility for missionary work in their units, and they inspire members to
participate.

Brothers and sisters on each ward council are beginning to catch the wave. On
that council is the ward mission leader.[4] I would like to speak specifically
to each of you ward mission leaders. You have been called by your bishop to
lead missionary work in the ward. And some of you are so successful that an
assistant has also been called to help you. Along with others on the ward
council, you identify less-active members, part-member families, and
interested neighbors. You meet regularly with assigned full-time missionaries.
You advise and assist the missionaries. Please help them to fill their daily
planners with focused and meaningful teaching opportunities. This is your
responsibility. Your role is crucial, truly crucial to the success of this
work. If you catch the wave with faith and enthusiasm, others will also. You,
as the ward mission leader, are _the_ connecting link between members and
missionaries in this sacred work of rescuing God's children.[5]

Our inquiring friends and neighbors not of our faith can also catch the wave.
We encourage them to keep all that is good and true in their lives. And we
invite them to receive more, especially the glorious truth that through God's
eternal plan, families can be together forever.[6]

This wave of truth and righteousness is wondrous! It is _not_ man-made! It
comes from the Lord, who said, "I will hasten my work in its time."[7] This
wave is empowered by a divine announcement made 193 years ago. It consisted of
only seven words: "This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!"[8] Uttered by Almighty
God, that announcement introduced a young Joseph Smith to the Lord Jesus
Christ. Those seven words launched the Restoration of His gospel. Why? Because
our living God is a loving God! He wants His children to know Him and Jesus
Christ, whom He has sent![9] And He wants His children to gain immortality and
eternal life![10]

For this glorious purpose, our missionaries teach of the Restoration. They
know that some 2,000 years ago, the Lord established His Church. After His
Crucifixion and the death of His Apostles, men changed the Church and its
doctrine. Then, after generations of spiritual darkness, and as predicted by
previous prophets,[11] Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ restored the Church,
its doctrine, and its priesthood authority. Because of that Restoration,
knowledge and essential ordinances for salvation and exaltation are again
available to all people.[12] Ultimately, that exaltation allows each of us to
dwell with our families in the presence of God and Jesus Christ forever!

I cannot speak of the Restoration in tempered tones. This fact of history is
absolutely stunning! It is incredible! It is breathtaking! How amazing is it
that messengers from heaven came to give authority and power to this work?

Our Eternal Father and Jesus Christ made multiple appearances to the Prophet
Joseph Smith.[13] Under Their direction, other heavenly messengers came, each
with a specific purpose. For example:

  * The angel Moroni revealed the Book of Mormon.[14]
  * John the Baptist restored the Aaronic Priesthood.[15]
  * Peter, James, and John restored the Melchizedek Priesthood.[16]
  * Moses bestowed keys for the gathering of Israel.[17]
  * Elias conferred keys of knowledge about Abraham.[18]
  * Elijah restored keys of the sealing authority.[19]

In addition, the Restoration added knowledge that Saints had anciently. The
Lord provided a new book of scripture. To the Holy Bible, He added the Book of
Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ. It is a record of prophecies and
the ministry of the resurrected Lord to the people of ancient America. It
explains God's great plan of happiness[20]--the plan of salvation.[21] The
Book of Mormon is in full harmony with the Bible. Both sacred records affirm
the truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the importance of His
Atonement.[22]

The Restoration fulfills many biblical prophecies. For example, Isaiah
prophesied that the Lord's house shall be established in the top of the
mountains.[23] The exodus of Mormon pioneers to the mountains of western
America is a fulfilling saga of sacrifice and faith. Isaiah also foretold that
God will do "a marvellous work and a wonder."[24] That is now being fulfilled
by the sacred work of our growing army of missionaries.

Old Testament teachings about tithing have been restored.[25] As a result,
more tithe payers are blessed because of their obedience. References to
Melchizedek are clarified by scriptures of the Restoration.[26] Prophecies
that the stick of Joseph (the Book of Mormon) and the stick of Judah (the
Bible) would be as one in God's hand have now been fulfilled.[27]

The Restoration also clarifies New Testament scriptures. Its reference to
baptism for the dead is now better understood.[28] Ordinances for our deceased
ancestors are now performed vicariously in 141 temples throughout the world!
There is no other way to offer salvation to our ancestors who died without a
knowledge of the gospel![29] John the Revelator's vision of "another angel
[flying] in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto
them that dwell on the earth," foretold the mission of the angel Moroni and
the Book of Mormon.[30]

The Book of Mormon is the centerpiece of the Restoration. It was written,
preserved, and transmitted under the Lord's direction. It was translated "by
the gift and power of God."[31] The book of Doctrine and Covenants contains
many additional revelations given to the Prophet Joseph Smith. Through him we
have received more pages of scripture than we have from any other prophet. In
what must have been a wistful moment, he said to the Saints in Nauvoo,
Illinois, "I never told you I was perfect; but there is no error in the
revelations which I have taught."[32]

Together, members and missionaries invite all to learn of God, of Jesus
Christ, and of His gospel. Each inquiring individual should seek earnestly and
pray fervently for the assurance that these things are true. The truth will be
manifest by the power of the Holy Ghost.[33]

I thank God and His Son, Jesus Christ, for the Restoration and its power to
propel a magnificent wave of truth and righteousness across the earth. May we
catch this wave and fulfill the Lord's command to take the gospel "to every
nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,"[34] I pray in the name of Jesus
Christ, amen.
