# His Arm Is Sufficient

Many years ago while serving on the Relief Society general board, I was on an
assignment to teach and train some Relief Society and priesthood leaders. We
had arrived just in time for the meeting to begin, after having spent the
morning teaching in another city.

I was the first speaker, following the opening song and prayer. The opening
song was announced as "The Time Is Far Spent."

I was not familiar with the title of this hymn and thought that it was odd
that this was to be the opening song. I hadn't even spoken, and already they
were singing that the time was far spent!

As we began singing the song, I soon realized that it referred to the little
time that is remaining to publish the gospel message and bring souls to
Christ. The words of the fourth verse ran through my mind the whole evening
and many times since then. It says:

_Be fixed in your purpose, for Satan will try you;_

_The weight of your calling he perfectly knows._

_Your path may be thorny, but Jesus is nigh you;_

_His arm is sufficient, tho demons oppose._

_His arm is sufficient, tho demons oppose._[1]

The message of that verse is that whatever happens in life, Jesus Christ has
the power to save. Through His divine sacrifice, He has provided the way for
us to gain eternal life. Truly, His work is "to bring to pass the immortality
and eternal life of man."[2] He has asked for our assistance in helping one
another do the things that will lead to eternal life.

Last September in the general Relief Society meeting, Sister Beck outlined
three things to help us in our goal to obtain eternal life. They are:

  1. "Increase in faith and personal righteousness."
  2. "Strengthen families and homes."
  3. "Serve the Lord and His children."[3] This also means to seek out and care for the poor and needy. 

We know Satan will tempt and try us as we seek to do these things, but the
Lord has promised that He will strengthen us. He will help us.[4]

## Increase in Faith and Personal Righteousness

As a child I was taught by my parents that my Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ
love me. I was taught that "I am a child of God."[5] I can't remember when I
didn't know this. They taught me that Jesus Christ is our Savior and only
through Him can we be saved.[6]

I was also taught that in order for my faith to increase, I needed to pray
every day. In fact, I needed to pray always.[7] I was taught that as I read
and studied the scriptures, my knowledge and testimony of the truthfulness of
the gospel would grow. I was taught to love God and that I could show my love
by keeping His commandments.[8] I also learned as a child about the importance
of the temple. In my youth I learned that making and keeping sacred temple
covenants would keep me on course to eternal life.

Each of us must follow these principles throughout our lives to increase our
faith and personal righteousness.

## Strengthen Families and Homes

It is the responsibility and blessing of each of us to strengthen our families
and homes. Each of us is in a different family situation. Some families have a
mother and father with children at home. Some couples no longer have children
at home. Many members of the Church are single, and some are single parents.
Others are widows or widowers living alone.

No matter what our family looks like, each of us can work to strengthen our
own families or help in strengthening others.

Some ways to strengthen families are illustrated by the following example. I
had an assignment in the Boise, Idaho, area. After training on Saturday
afternoon, I stayed in the home of my niece and her family. That evening
before the children went to bed, we had a short family home evening and a
scripture story. Their father told about the family of Lehi and how he taught
his children that they must hold fast to the iron rod, which is the word of
God.[9] Holding fast to the iron rod would keep them safe and lead them to joy
and happiness. If they should let go of the iron rod, there was danger of
drowning in the river of dirty water.

To demonstrate this to the children, their mother became the "iron rod" that
they must cling to, and their father played the role of the devil, trying to
pull the children away from safety and happiness. The children loved the story
and learned how important it is to hold fast to the iron rod.

After the scripture story it was time for family prayer. Their mother reminded
the children to pray for the bishop, who was having serious eye problems.
Three-year-old Brooklyn offered the prayer that evening. She thanked Heavenly
Father for their blessings, and then she fervently asked Him to "bless the
bishop because his eyes are broken."

The next morning we got to sacrament meeting and got seated. Brooklyn and her
five-year-old sister, Kennedy, looked up on the stand and saw the bishop
standing there. The girls pointed to the bishop and excitedly said to their
mother, "Look, there's the bishop." Then a knowing look passed between these
two little girls that seemed to say "We prayed for the bishop, and now he is
better." They prayed in faith, knowing that Heavenly Father would hear their
humble prayers.

Scriptures, family home evening, and family prayer will strengthen families.
We need to take every opportunity to strengthen families and support one
another to stay on the right path.

## Serve the Lord and His Children, and Seek Out and Care for the Poor and
Needy

Throughout His mortal life the Savior taught that we should care for one
another and help one another. He healed the sick, caused the lame to walk,
restored sight to the blind, and unstopped the ears of the deaf. He taught the
people the gospel. He blessed the people and performed many mighty
miracles.[10]

There are opportunities everywhere to help those in need. I submit to you that
at some time in our lives, each of us will be poor in some way and will need
the help of another person. For "are we not all beggars?"[11]

President Spencer W. Kimball said: "God does notice us, and he watches over
us. But it is usually through another person that he meets our needs.
Therefore, it is vital that we serve each other."[12]

Last summer when I was away from home, a fierce wind and rainstorm blew
through our neighborhood. A huge tree had fallen from my neighbor's yard,
filling my yard and knocking down power lines. The tree needed to be removed
before the damage could be repaired and power restored to my home.

Early in the morning I called my brother, who planned to find some equipment
and come as soon as he could. I also called my bishop. Within minutes my
bishop, home teacher, former stake president, and 10 men from my ward were
there with their chain saws and made quick work of this disaster. My visiting
teachers brought in dinner that evening. Many more men from the high priests
group, the elders quorum, and the neighborhood came on subsequent evenings to
assist me and my family in cleaning up the mess.

I was needy on that occasion. I needed help from others. My discouragement
turned into joy and gratitude. I felt loved and cared for. These people were
quick to recognize one in need. They lived their testimony and demonstrated
the reality of their covenants.

At Church headquarters we often receive thank-you notes from people not of our
church who have been served by you after a flood, hurricane, earthquake, or
other disaster. Thank you for always being willing to serve, love, give, and
thus be a true disciple of Jesus Christ.

We must be "fixed in [our] purpose"[13] as we seek to increase in faith and
personal righteousness, strengthen our families and homes, and serve the Lord
and His children. Though Satan may oppose our efforts, I testify of Jesus
Christ and the power of His atoning sacrifice, enabling us to do His will and
magnifying our efforts in the process. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
