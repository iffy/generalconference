# Sacred Homes, Sacred Temples

What a wonderful conference it has been. How blessed we are to hear the
counsel of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve, whom we sustain
as prophets, seers, and revelators.

I remember a warm, sunny afternoon when spring was trying to nudge its way
through a long winter in Cache Valley, Utah. My father, whose Saturdays were
always filled with chores for his grandsons, stopped by our home with an offer
to "go for a ride." Always happy to ride in Grandpa's truck, our four- and
six-year-old sons scurried into the back jump seat, and I joined my father in
the front. Our drive took us through the streets of downtown Logan, which wrap
around the Logan Temple, prominently situated on a hill, centered beautifully
in the city. As we moved further away from the city, we turned from paved,
busy streets to seldom-used dirt roads, where we crossed old bridges and
weaved through trees far into the country. We were far from any other traffic
and all alone.

Realizing his grandsons were in a place they had not been before, my father
stopped the truck. "Do you think we are lost?" he asked the wide-eyed boys as
they gazed out the windshield across the valley. Followed by a moment of
silent assessment came the profound reply of a young child. "Look," he said,
pointing his finger. "Grandpa, you are never lost when you can see the
temple." Our eyes turned, focusing with his, seeing the sun glistening off the
spires of the Logan Temple, far across the valley.

You are never lost when you can see the temple. The temple will provide
direction for you and your family in a world filled with chaos. It is an
eternal guidepost which will help you from getting lost in the "mist of
darkness."[1] It is the house of the Lord.[2] It is a place where covenants
are made and eternal ordinances are performed.

In the Book of Mormon, King Benjamin directed the Saints of his time and place
to gather, "every man having his tent with the door thereof towards the
temple."[3] As Church members, we have recently received counsel from modern-
day prophets which, if followed, will turn the doors of our homes more fully
towards the temple.

The First Presidency has invited "adult members to have a current temple
recommend and visit the temple more often" where time and circumstance permit
and encouraged members "to replace some leisure activities with temple
service." They also encouraged "newer members and youth of the Church who are
12 years of age and older to live worthy to assist in this great work by
serving as proxies for baptisms and confirmations."[4] Even our young children
have been encouraged to visit the temple grounds and touch the temple.[5]
President Thomas S. Monson once counseled, "As we touch the temple, the temple
will touch us."[6]

We are blessed to live in a temple-building dispensation in which 146 temples
have been dedicated or announced.[7] Under the definition of "Temple" in the
Bible Dictionary, we read the following: "It is the most holy of any place of
worship on the earth," followed by this insightful statement: "Only the home
can compare with the temple in sacredness."[8] For me this suggests a sacred
relationship between the temple and the home. Not only can we turn the doors
of our homes to the temple, or the house of the Lord; we can make our homes a
"house of the Lord."

Recently, in a stake conference, all present were invited by the visiting
authority, Elder Glen Jenson, an Area Seventy, to take a virtual tour of their
homes using their spiritual eyes. I would like to invite each of you to do
this also. Wherever your home may be and whatever its configuration, the
application of eternal gospel principles within its walls is universal. Let's
begin. Imagine that you are opening your front door and walking inside your
home. What do you see, and how do you feel? Is it a place of love, peace, and
refuge from the world, as is the temple? Is it clean and orderly? As you walk
through the rooms of your home, do you see uplifting images which include
appropriate pictures of the temple and the Savior? Is your bedroom or sleeping
area a place for personal prayer? Is your gathering area or kitchen a place
where food is prepared and enjoyed together, allowing uplifting conversation
and family time? Are scriptures found in a room where the family can study,
pray, and learn together? Can you find your personal gospel study space? Does
the music you hear or the entertainment you see, online or otherwise, offend
the Spirit? Is the conversation uplifting and without contention? That
concludes our tour. Perhaps you, as I, found a few spots that need some "home
improvement"--hopefully not an "extreme home makeover."

Whether our living space is large or small, humble or extravagant, there is a
place for each of these gospel priorities in each of our homes.

In order to keep the temple and those who attend it sacred and worthy, the
Lord has established standards through His servants, the prophets. We may be
well-advised to consider together, in family council, standards for our homes
to keep them sacred and to allow them to be a "house of the Lord." The
admonition to "establish ... a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of
faith, a house of learning, a house of glory, a house of order, a house of
God"[9] provides divine insight into the type of home the Lord would have us
build. Doing such begins the construction of a "spiritual mansion" in which we
all may reside regardless of our worldly circumstance--a home filled with
treasure that "neither moth nor rust doth corrupt."[10]

There exists a righteous unity between the temple and the home. Understanding
the eternal nature of the temple will draw you to your family; understanding
the eternal nature of the family will draw you to the temple. President Howard
W. Hunter stated, "In the ordinances of the temple, the foundations of the
eternal family are sealed in place."[11]

President Boyd K. Packer counseled: "Say the word _temple._ Say it quietly and
reverently. Say it over and over again. _Temple. Temple. Temple._ Add the word
_holy. Holy Temple._ Say it as though it were capitalized, no matter where it
appears in the sentence.

"Temple. One other word is equal in importance to a Latter-day Saint. _Home._
Put the words _holy temple_ and _home _together, and you have described the
house of the Lord!"[12]

Last year Primary children gathered, thousands of them, from around the world
in each of their wards and branches, singing to their families and ward
members as part of the Primary sacrament meeting presentation. They sang of
desire, promises, and preparation. The things of which they sang begin in
sacred homes and continue in sacred temples. I think you will hear the tune in
your hearts as I read the words:

_I love to see the temple._

_I'm going there someday_

_To feel the Holy Spirit,_

_To listen and to pray._

_For the temple is a house of God,_

_A place of love and beauty._

_I'll prepare myself while I am young;_

_This is my sacred duty._

_I love to see the temple._

_I'll go inside someday._

_I'll cov'nant with my Father;_

_I'll promise to obey._

_For the temple is a holy place_

_Where we are sealed together._

_As a child of God, I've learned this truth:_

_A fam'ly is forever._[13]

President Boyd K. Packer stated, "The ultimate purpose of all we teach is to
unite parents and children in faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, that they are
happy at home, sealed in an eternal marriage, linked to their generations, and
assured of exaltation in the presence of our Heavenly Father."[14]

I testify to you that the application of these principles will help turn the
doors of your home to the temple, or house of the Lord, and more fully allow
you to make your sacred home a house of the Lord.

I conclude where I began, with the words of an innocent child: "You are never
lost when you can see the temple." And I add my testimony of the sacred nature
of our homes and of the Lord's temples. I know that God is our loving Heavenly
Father. I bear witness of Jesus Christ and of His role as our Savior and
Redeemer and of living prophets authorized to exercise all priesthood keys
from Joseph Smith to Thomas S. Monson. I do so in the sacred name of Jesus
Christ, amen.

He recounted the late Elder Matthew Cowley's story about a grandfather who took his small granddaughter on a birthday visit to the Salt Lake Temple grounds. With permission of the groundskeeper, they walked to the large doors of the temple. He suggested that she place her hand on the temple wall and then on the door, saying tenderly to her, 'Remember that this day you touched the temple. One day you will enter this door.' His special gift to his granddaughter was an appreciation for the House of the Lord. Likewise, counseled Elder Monson, 'As we touch the temple, the temple will touch us.'"
