# “Sacred Resolves”

Brethren and sisters, traditionally the President of the Church, at the close
of the conference, has offered words of benediction. President Benson, who is
now in his ninety-first year, feels that he could not stand and address us,
but I wish to say that we have been greatly uplifted by his very presence,
with his smile and the wave of a hand as an expression of love.

May I, in conclusion, read some of the words he has said in the past on this
occasion and from this pulpit.

"I commend my Brethren ... for the excellent addresses they have given. My
humble prayer is that all of us will follow the counsel and instruction we
have received.

"As we have felt the Spirit and made new and sacred resolves, may we now have
the courage and fortitude to carry out those resolves." (_Ensign,_ May 1988,
p. 84.)

"We should like to reaffirm to all the world that The Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-day Saints is led by our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. We believe in
Christ. We accept and affirm His teachings as revealed truths from God. We
know Him to be the literal Son of God. We love Him as our resurrected Lord and
Savior.

"We believe there is 'none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we
must be saved' ([Acts
4:12](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/acts/4.12?lang=eng#11).)

"So we invite all men, as the Book of Mormon declares, to 'Come unto Christ,
and be [redeemed] in him, and deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and love God
with all your [heart], mind and strength.' ([Moro.
10:32](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.32?lang=eng#31))."
(_Ensign,_ Dec. 1985, p. 5.)

"I bear witness to you that Jesus is the Christ, the Savior and Redeemer of
the world--the very Son of God.

"He was _born_ the babe of Bethlehem.

"He _lived_ and ministered among men.

"He was _crucified_ on Calvary.

"His friends _deserted_ Him.

"His closest associates did not fully _understand_ his mission, and they
_doubted._ One of the most trusted _denied_ knowing Him. ...

"He asked _forgiveness_ for His tormenters and then willingly gave up his
life.

"His body was _laid_ in a borrowed tomb.

"An immense stone was placed over the opening.

"In the minds of his stunned followers over and over echoed some of his last
words, '... be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.' [[John
16:33](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/16.33?lang=eng#32).]" (In
Conference Report, Apr. 1964, p. 119.)

Last Thursday, in a meeting in the temple of all of the General Authorities,
where we bore testimonies one to another and partook of the sacrament of the
Lord's Supper, President Benson stood before his brethren and said with
conviction and emotion, "I love you, my brethren. I bless you in your great
ministry."

Every man there was deeply touched as he felt of the spirit of our great
leader. As we close this conference, I am confident he would have me say to
each of you in his behalf, "I love you, my brethren and sisters. I bless you
in the great work which you are doing in living the gospel of Jesus Christ and
in carrying out His teachings."

To these words of his I add my own testimony that God our Eternal Father
lives; that Jesus is the Christ, the Only Begotten of the Father born in the
flesh, the Savior and Redeemer of mankind, who offered His life on Calvary's
cross in atonement for the sins of all mankind; that Joseph Smith was a
prophet of the living God; and that every man who has succeeded him in the
office of the Presidency of this Church has been a living prophet--including
Ezra Taft Benson, whom we love and for whom we pray as the Lord's anointed in
our day and time. Of these things I testify and leave my blessings. May God be
with you and bless you as you travel to your homes, and may His guiding light
be the lodestar of your lives, I humbly ask, in the name of Jesus Christ,
amen.
