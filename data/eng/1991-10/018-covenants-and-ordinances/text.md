# Covenants and Ordinances

I see there are many fathers and sons together. May I ask you to join me in
something we all do at home very often. Thank you.

Hello, my son. How are you? How was your day at school? Good. Any calls? The
bishop? An interview with you? Well, that's OK. Bishops have interviews all
the time with young boys--just like the ones we have. We talk, we listen, we
learn from each other, we have a great time. No. It's the same thing. Don't
worry. It's going to be all right.

Let's see ... you'll be twelve next month, and he wants to have an interview
with you. I wouldn't miss this for anything. Yes, he'll ask you questions
about school and friends, the Word of Wisdom. Do you make your bed every
morning? Do you take a shower every day? No, I'm not kidding you. He'll talk
about those things. I'm serious. He'll ask, "Are you praying to your Heavenly
Father every day? Are you reading the scriptures? Do you love the Lord?" Do
you? Do you, my son? That's good.

He'll talk about covenants and ordinances. No ... no ... _co-ve-nants,_ covenants
and ordinances. That's a good question. I knew you'd ask me that. Oh, they are
like ... you know ... covenants and ordinances. Come over here.

You just told me you love Heavenly Father. I do too, my son. Now, Father in
Heaven loves us. He knows you and your brothers and sisters. He knows all of
us by name. And He loves us so much that He is waiting for us. He wants us to
go back to Him.

In order to go back, we need to love and have faith in Jesus Christ. The Lord
said a very important thing to all of us. "I am the way, the truth, and the
life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me." ([John
14:6](/scriptures/nt/john/14.6?lang=eng#5).) Now, that's a very, very
important thing to know. _No one goes back without His help._ Very important.

But then He said something else. "If ye love me, keep my commandments." ([John
14:15](/scriptures/nt/john/14.15?lang=eng#14).) So, we love Him by keeping His
commandments. And He loves us by helping us go back. Now, that's an agreement
between Him and us. It's a very sacred agreement. Sacred agreements between
Him and us are called _covenants._

Remember your baptism? You first agreed to have faith in Him, repent of your
sins, and live a good, righteous life. And He agreed to help you go back. That
was the agreement, that was a covenant you both made.

But then you had to make the agreement official--just like you do when you
write down an agreement on paper, but to make it official, to make it stand,
you both sign your name on that written agreement. When you want to make an
agreement with the Lord official, you don't sign a document; you perform an
ordinance. Ordinances are also very sacred.

After the covenant, or agreement, is made, and after the ordinance is
performed, there is yet a third, vital element. You must live up to the
agreement. This third element is also very sacred. Because the other two now
depend entirely on your performance. What good will a covenant do (I agree to
do something), or an ordinance (I hereby sign the agreement) if you ultimately
_don't comply with it?_ Understand?

The first covenant and ordinance the Lord requires is baptism. Baptism puts us
on the _starting line_--the starting line of that road that will take us back
to His presence. As we walk along this road, there are _other covenants_ we
must accept and _other ordinances_ we must receive. But remember the third
important element for each one of them: _We must live up to each new covenant
we make._

I think the bishop wants to talk to you about another covenant and ordinance
you now need to make with the Lord. It is called priesthood. Son, the
priesthood will bless your life. The bishop will make sure you understand, so
you'll be able to make the priesthood covenant with the Lord. Once you make
the covenant, you will need to receive the ordinance. I will then be so happy,
my son, to perform the ordinance and ordain you a deacon.

This will help you stay on that road that will take you back to His presence.
It will be necessary for you to keep growing and moving forward on that road.
Two years later, you will need additional help. If you remain worthy, you take
another step; you'll then be ready to become a teacher in the priesthood. That
will require that you make another covenant, and then I will again perform the
ordinance and ordain you a teacher. Two years later, if everything is well,
again another step, and I will ordain you a priest.

Soon after that, you will be ready to now receive the higher priesthood, or
the Melchizedek Priesthood, and _be ordained an elder._ My son, when you
receive the higher priesthood, you will have all the priesthood there is. You
will then be ready to do what you've always wanted to do: be a missionary for
the Lord Jesus Christ.

By then you will better understand and be grateful to the Lord for all those
steps you have taken, the preparation you've received, and for the help He has
given you, all along the way, to finally be able to come to the house of the
Lord, the temple. There, my son, you will be able to accept the highest
covenants and receive the most sacred ordinances. There, too, you will be
reminded of the third element. Remember? After you accept covenants and
receive ordinances, _you must live up to the covenants you made._ That is how
we love our Lord: by keeping His commandments.

Are you ready for that interview with the bishop? Good.

We now need to review the things we talked about today and express our
gratitude to Heavenly Father. Do you want to review it, or offer a prayer?

All right. You review it, and I'll pray.

Yes. We must love the Lord. _If_ we love Him, _we keep His commandments._ Very
good.

His commandments are that we first, accept covenants; second, receive
ordinances; and third, live up to the things we promised Him.

That was excellent. Son, I love you.

Let's fold our arms, bow our heads, close our eyes, and pray.

Our dear Father in Heaven, we thank thee for thy many blessings--for the
restoration of the gospel, which makes possible that we have the Book of
Mormon, thy holy priesthood, and living prophets to guide us. We are grateful
for the atonement of Jesus Christ, for immortality and the possibility of
eternal life. Help us to make it a real probability as we come unto Christ
through sacred covenants and ordinances. Please forgive our sins. And help us
always recognize thy hand all around us and always, always keep thy
commandments, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
