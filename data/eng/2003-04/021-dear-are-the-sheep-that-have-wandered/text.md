# Dear Are the Sheep That Have Wandered

My dear brothers and sisters and friends, my message this morning is one of
hope and solace to heartbroken parents who have done their best to rear their
children in righteousness with love and devotion, but have despaired because
their child has rebelled or been led astray to follow the path of evil and
destruction. In contemplating your deep anguish, I am reminded of the words of
Jeremiah, "A voice was heard in Ramah, ... Rahel weeping for her children
refused to be comforted." To this the Lord gave this welcome reassurance,
"Refrain thy voice from weeping, ... for thy work shall be rewarded ... ; they
shall come again from the land of the enemy."[1]

I must begin by testifying that the word of the Lord to parents in this Church
is contained in the 68th section of the Doctrine and Covenants in this
remarkable instruction: "And again, inasmuch as parents have children in Zion,
or in any of her stakes which are organized, that teach them not to understand
the doctrine of repentance, faith in Christ the Son of the living God, and of
baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands, when
eight years old, the sin be upon the heads of the parents."[2] Parents are
instructed to "teach their children to pray, and to walk uprightly before the
Lord."[3] As a father, grandfather, and great-grandfather, I accept this as
the word of the Lord, and as a servant of Jesus Christ, I urge parents to
follow this counsel as conscientiously as they can.

Who are good parents? They are those who have lovingly, prayerfully, and
earnestly tried to teach their children by example and precept "to pray, and
to walk uprightly before the Lord."[4] This is true even though some of their
children are disobedient or worldly. Children come into this world with their
own distinct spirits and personality traits. Some children "would challenge
any set of parents under any set of circumstances. ... Perhaps there are others
who would bless the lives of, and be a joy to, almost any father or
mother."[5] Successful parents are those who have sacrificed and struggled to
do the best they can in their own family circumstances.

The depth of the love of parents for their children cannot be measured. It is
like no other relationship. It exceeds concern for life itself. The love of a
parent for a child is continuous and transcends heartbreak and disappointment.
All parents hope and pray that their children will make wise decisions.
Children who are obedient and responsible bring to their parents unending
pride and satisfaction.

But what if the children who have been taught by faithful, loving parents have
rebelled or been led astray? Is there hope? The grief of a parent over a
rebellious child is almost inconsolable. King David's third son, Absalom,
killed one of his brothers and also led a rebellion against his father.
Absalom was killed by Joab. Upon hearing of Absalom's death, King David wept
and expressed his sadness: "O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would
God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!"[6]

This paternal love is also expressed in the parable of the prodigal son. When
his rebellious son returned home after having squandered his inheritance in
riotous living, the father killed the fatted calf and celebrated the return of
the prodigal, saying to his obedient, if resentful, son, "It was meet that we
should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive
again; and was lost, and is found."[7]

I believe and accept the comforting statement of Elder Orson F. Whitney:

"The Prophet Joseph Smith declared--and he never taught more comforting
doctrine--that the eternal sealings of faithful parents and the divine
promises made to them for valiant service in the Cause of Truth, would save
not only themselves, but likewise their posterity. Though some of the sheep
may wander, the eye of the Shepherd is upon them, and sooner or later they
will feel the tentacles of Divine Providence reaching out after them and
drawing them back to the fold. Either in this life or the life to come, they
will return. They will have to pay their debt to justice; they will suffer for
their sins; and may tread a thorny path; but if it leads them at last, like
the penitent Prodigal, to a loving and forgiving father's heart and home, the
painful experience will not have been in vain. Pray for your careless and
disobedient children; hold on to them with your faith. Hope on, trust on, till
you see the salvation of God."[8]

A principle in this statement that is often overlooked is that they must fully
repent and "suffer for their sins" and "pay their debt to justice." I
recognize that now is the time "to prepare to meet God."[9] If the repentance
of the wayward children does not happen in this life, is it still possible for
the cords of the sealing to be strong enough for them yet to work out their
repentance? In the Doctrine and Covenants we are told, "The dead who repent
will be redeemed, through obedience to the ordinances of the house of God,

"And after they have paid the penalty of their transgressions, and are washed
clean, shall receive a reward according to their works, for they are heirs of
salvation."[10]

We remember that the prodigal son wasted his inheritance, and when it was all
gone he came back to his father's house. There he was welcomed back into the
family, but his inheritance was spent.[11] Mercy will not rob justice, and the
sealing power of faithful parents will only claim wayward children upon the
condition of their repentance and Christ's Atonement. Repentant wayward
children will enjoy salvation and all the blessings that go with it, but
exaltation is much more. It must be fully earned. The question as to who will
be exalted must be left to the Lord in His mercy.

There are very few whose rebellion and evil deeds are so great that they have
"sinned away the power to repent."[12] That judgment must also be left up to
the Lord. He tells us, "I, the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive, but of
you it is required to forgive all men."[13]

Perhaps in this life we are not given to fully understand how enduring the
sealing cords of righteous parents are to their children. It may very well be
that there are more helpful sources at work than we know.[14] I believe there
is a strong familial pull as the influence of beloved ancestors continues with
us from the other side of the veil.

President Howard W. Hunter observed that "repentance is but the homesickness
of the soul, and the uninterrupted and watchful care of the parent is the
fairest earthly type of the unfailing forgiveness of God." Is not the family
the nearest analogy which the Savior's mission sought to establish?[15]

We learn much of parenting from our own parents. My love for my father
deepened profoundly when he was kind, patient, and understanding. When I
damaged the family car, he was gentle and forgiving. But his sons could expect
strong discipline if there was any shading of the truth or continued breaking
of the rules, particularly showing disrespect for our mother. My father has
been gone for almost half a century, but I still sorely miss being able to go
to him for wise and loving counsel. I admit I questioned his counsel at times,
but I could never question his love for me. I never wanted to disappoint him.

An important element of doing the best we can as parents is to provide loving
but firm discipline. If we do not discipline our children, society may do it
in a way that is not to our liking or our children's. Part of disciplining
children is to teach them to work. President Gordon B. Hinckley has said: "One
of the greatest values ... is the virtue of honest work. Knowledge without labor
is profitless. Knowledge with labor is genius."[16]

Satan's pervasive snares are increasing, and raising children is becoming
harder because of this. Therefore, parents need to do the very best they can
and to enlist the help that Church service and activity can provide. If
parents misbehave and stray even temporarily, some of their children may be
prone to take license from that example.

Now there is another side to this coin that needs to be mentioned. I make a
plea for children who are estranged from their parents to reach out to them,
even if they have been less than they should have been. Children who are
critical of their parents might well remember the wise counsel of Moroni when
he said, "Condemn me not because of mine imperfection, neither my father,
because of his imperfection, neither them who have written before him; but
rather give thanks unto God that he hath made manifest unto you our
imperfections, that ye may learn to be more wise than we have been."[17]

When Moroni visited the young Prophet Joseph Smith in 1823, he quoted the
following verse concerning the mission of Elijah: "And he shall plant in the
hearts of the children the promises made to the fathers, and the hearts of the
children shall turn to their fathers."[18] I hope all children will eventually
turn their hearts to their fathers and also to their mothers.

A wonderful couple I knew in my youth had a son who was rebellious and
estranged himself from their family. But in their later years, he reconciled
with them and was the most caring and solicitous of all their children. As we
get older, the pull from our parents and grandparents on the other side of the
veil becomes stronger. It is a sweet experience when they visit us in our
dreams.

It is very unfair and unkind to judge conscientious and faithful parents
because some of their children rebel or stray from the teachings and love of
their parents. Fortunate are the couples who have children and grandchildren
who bring them comfort and satisfaction. We should be considerate of those
worthy, righteous parents who struggle and suffer with disobedient children.
One of my friends used to say, "If you have never had any problems with your
children, just wait awhile." No one can say with any degree of certainty what
their children will do under certain circumstances. When my wise mother-in-law
saw other children misbehaving, she used to say, "I never say my children
would not do that because they might be out doing it right while I am
speaking!" When parents mourn for disobedient and wayward children we must,
with compassion, "forbid the casting of the first stone."[19]

An anonymous Church member wrote about the continuous heartache her brother
caused her parents. He got involved in drugs. He resisted all efforts at
control and discipline. He was deceitful and defiant. Unlike the prodigal,
this errant son did not come home of his own accord. Instead he got caught by
the police and was forced to face the consequences of his actions. For two
years his parents supported Bill's treatment program, which brought about his
eventual recovery from drugs. In summary, Bill's sister observed: "I think my
parents are extraordinary. They never wavered in their love for Bill, though
they disagreed with and even hated what he was doing to himself and to their
family life. But they were committed enough to their family to support Bill in
any way necessary to get him through the tough times and onto more solid
ground. They practiced the deeper, more sensitive, and extensive gospel of
Christ by loving one who had gone astray."[20]

Let us not be arrogant but rather humbly grateful if our children are obedient
and respectful of our teachings of the ways of the Lord. To those
brokenhearted parents who have been righteous, diligent, and prayerful in the
teaching of their disobedient children, we say to you, the Good Shepherd is
watching over them. God knows and understands your deep sorrow. There is hope.
Take comfort in the words of Jeremiah, "Thy work shall be rewarded" and your
children can "come again from the land of the enemy."[21] I so testify and
pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
