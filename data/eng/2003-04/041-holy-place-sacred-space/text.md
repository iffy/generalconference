# Holy Place, Sacred Space

In answer to Pilate's question "Art thou the King of the Jews?" the Savior
answered, "My kingdom is not of this world" ([John 18:33,
36](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/18.33%2C36?lang=eng#32)). With
these few words, Jesus declares His kingdom independent and distinct from this
world. The Savior's teachings, doctrine, and personal example lift all who
truly believe in Him to a divine standard that requires both eye and mind be
single to the glory of God (see [D&amp;C 4:5](https://www.lds.org/scriptures
/dc-testament/dc/4.5?lang=eng#4); [D&amp;C
88:68](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.68?lang=eng#67)). The
glory of God encompasses all that is holy and sacred. Our ability to seek,
recognize, and reverence the holy above the profane, and the sacred above the
secular, defines our spirituality. Indeed, without the holy and sacred, we are
left with only the profane and secular.

Amidst the bustle of the secular world, with its certain uncertainty, there
must be places that offer spiritual refuge, renewal, hope, and peace. There
are indeed such places. They are both holy and sacred. They are places where
we meet the divine and find the Spirit of the Lord.

Three times in the Doctrine and Covenants the Lord counsels His people to
"stand in holy places" (see [D&amp;C 45:32](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-
testament/dc/45.32?lang=eng#31); [D&amp;C 87:8](https://www.lds.org/scriptures
/dc-testament/dc/87.8?lang=eng#7); [D&amp;C
101:22](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.22?lang=eng#21)).
The context of His counsel is all the more significant as we look at the
current condition of our world. Desolating disease, persecution, and war have
an all-too-familiar face and have imposed themselves into our daily
experience. In the face of such perplexing problems, the Lord counsels,
"Behold, it is my will, that all they who call on my name, and worship me
according to mine everlasting gospel, should gather together, and stand in
holy places" ([D&amp;C 101:22](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-
testament/dc/101.22?lang=eng#21)).

Holy places have always been essential to the proper worship of God. For
Latter-day Saints, such holy places include venues of historic significance,
our homes, sacrament meetings, and temples. Much of what we reverence, and
what we teach our children to reverence as holy and sacred, is reflected in
these places. The faith and reverence associated with them and the respect we
have for what transpires or has transpired in them make them holy. The
importance of holy places and sacred space in our worship can hardly be
overestimated.

Great personal preparation is required for us to receive the spiritual benefit
of standing in holy places. Holy places and sacred space are also
distinguished by the sacrifice they require. Elder M. Russell Ballard has
taught that "the word _sacrifice_ means literally 'to make sacred,' or 'to
render sacred'" ("The Law of Sacrifice," _Ensign,_ Oct. 1998, 8; _Liahona,_
Mar. 2002, 13). The words _sacred_ and _sacrifice_ come from the same root.
One may not have the sacred without first sacrificing something for it. There
can be no sacredness without personal sacrifice. Sacrifice sanctifies the
sacred.

To many, the grove near the Smith farm in upstate New York is simply beautiful
and peaceful. To Latter-day Saints across the world, however, it is sacred
because of the faith and reverence we bring to it and the depth of sacrifice
it represents.

Some months ago on a beautiful late fall day, my wife and I sat in that grove.
It was indeed beautiful, and we did enjoy the solitary peace we found there.
However, it was significantly more than that, for we sat in the immediate
vicinity where God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, appeared to the young
Prophet Joseph Smith. Our faith in, and our reverence for, their visit and the
personal sacrifice that ensued because of it, both in the Prophet's life as
well as in the lives of our own ancestors, transformed this beautiful spot
into sacred space and a holy place.

Similar deep and reverent feelings are aroused by other sacred places across
the earth relating to the history and establishment of this Church. These
sacred places inspire our faith and give us encouragement to be true to that
faith and to move forward, despite the challenges that may cross our path.

Our homes, likewise, are holy places filled with sacred space. Though not
always tranquil, our homes can be filled with the Spirit of the Lord. The
First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles teach in "The Family: A
Proclamation to the World": "Happiness in family life is most likely to be
achieved when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ. Successful
marriages and families are established and maintained on principles of faith,
prayer, repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and
wholesome recreational activities" (_Ensign,_ Nov. 1995, 102; _Liahona,_ Oct.
1998, 24).

Such a home does require personal sacrifice. To the Prophet Joseph Smith the
Lord said, "Your family must needs repent and forsake some things" ([D&amp;C
93:48](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.48?lang=eng#47)).
Each of our families is confronted with a broad menu of activities and
entertainment, not all of which is wholesome and good--and much of which is
certainly not necessary. Like the Prophet's family, do our families also need
to repent and forsake some things to help us maintain the sacred nature of our
homes? The establishment of our homes as holy places reflects the depth of
sacrifice we are willing to make for them.

Sacrament meetings are really more than just meetings. They are sacred moments
in a holy place. During these weekly moments, we reflect on the most merciful
act of sacrifice this world has ever known. We ponder the love of God, who
gave His Only Begotten Son that we might obtain eternal life. As we partake of
the sacrament, we remember Him and express our willingness to take His name
upon us and to keep His commandments. Careful personal preparation, including
our own sacrifice of a broken heart and contrite spirit, is prerequisite to
the regular spiritual renewal offered through worthy participation. We must be
willing and capable of slipping away from the world for just a few moments in
order to reflect on holier things. Without this spiritual renewal, our faith
is easily overcome by the secular and profane.

Many years ago when our boys were still very young, I made a remark at dinner
regarding the excellence of our sacrament meeting and how much I had learned.
Their response was a look that told me that they were not sure that we had
even been in the same meeting. The difference between my experience and theirs
was simply one of a little maturity and personal preparation. The spiritual
renewal we receive from our sacrament meetings will not exceed our preparation
and our willingness and desire to be taught.

The temples, with "Holiness to the Lord" inscribed on them, are among the most
sacred of all places on the earth. They stand as evidence of God's love to all
His children, past and present. The blessings of the temple are intertwined
and inseparable from significant sacrifice. The ordinances performed therein
provide access to the full expression of the Savior's atoning sacrifice. This
alone would qualify the temple as holy and sacred. However, personal sacrifice
is also required. We sacrifice time in search for our ancestors and time to
attend to our temple responsibilities. We also strive to live the highest
standards of personal worthiness, which qualify us to enter the sacred space
of this most holy place.

In holy places and in sacred space we find spiritual refuge, renewal, hope,
and peace. Are these not worth every necessary personal sacrifice? My brethren
and sisters, may each of us revere and respect the holy and sacred in our
lives. May we teach our children likewise. Let us all stand in holy and sacred
places of spiritual peace.

I express my testimony of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, the very Prince of
Peace and Hope, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
