# Being Leaders Who Foster Growth

I am a stake Young Women leader, and like leaders in wards and stakes around
the world, I've been looking for significant ways to nourish the word.
Gratefully, we can turn to the formula Alma gives us in chapter 32, verse 41.
He says: "But if ye will nourish the word, yea, nourish the tree as it
beginneth to grow, by your faith with great diligence, and with patience,
looking forward to the fruit thereof, it shall take root; and behold it shall
be a tree springing up unto everlasting life."

Alma commends patience, great diligence, and faith to those who seek to
nourish the word.

Our patience must come from humility; we can't force this process. President
Boyd K. Packer reminds us: "You can create a climate to foster growth,
nourish, and protect; but you cannot force or compel: you must await the
growth.

"Do not be impatient to gain great spiritual knowledge. Let it grow, help it
grow, but do not force it or you will open the way to be misled" (_Ensign,_
Jan. 1983, p. 53).

As we involve the young women in planning firesides, group reading, and
creative ways to share their insights, we are fostering the growth they will
surely feel as they experiment upon the word. We can create opportunities to
read together, to record individual experiences, and to share through music,
art, and the words of testimony. We can testify and be nearby.

One group of ward presidents lamented that they'd gotten off to a great start,
but now, after being a few weeks into experimenting on the word, they needed a
"shot in the arm." This is where the "great diligence" part comes into play.
We must continue to plan with a purpose activities that center on the
scriptures. And even stay involved with the scriptures ourselves! Among one
group of ward leaders who had committed themselves to read, a Young Women
leader commented, "I hate to admit it, but you know, this really is hard for
me." Others in the group obviously appreciated her honesty as they then
expressed some of their own struggles and need to set realistic goals. Surely
the young women in that ward will find empathy and very practical helps from
leaders who have wrestled to find patience and diligence themselves.

Finally, we must have faith that Jesus can and will touch young women's hearts
as we work together toward the worldwide celebration. Faith always has an
element of doing. [John
7:17](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/7.17?lang=eng#16) gives us hope
that "if any [young woman] will do his will, [she] shall know of the
doctrine." (That may not be exactly the way you read that, but I feel sure
Nephi would approve, since he, too, likened the scriptures to himself.)
Service and personal progress projects are real nourishers of the word or
doctrine. Our efforts to _do_ really feed our efforts to _know_ and to _grow_
the word.

And surely our faith must involve prayers for and with our young women in
their efforts. My father composed a piece which includes this prayer for all
of us:

_Oh Lord, I would hear Thy word, which Thou sendest me in Thy mercy._

_Unseal my heart that I may lift it unto Thee._

_Unlock my searching spirit that I may seek Thee._

_Heal Thou my deafened ears; touch Thou my blinded eyes._

_Increase my joy in Thee, that I may rejoice in Thee,_

_Thou Holy One of Israel, that I may sanctify Thy name._

In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
