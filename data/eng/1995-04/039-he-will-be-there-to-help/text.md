# He Will Be There to Help

We are all different. Each of us has been given talents as well as challenges.
Some of us may have physical or mental limitations; others may be lonely or
come from homes that do not teach gospel principles. Because Heavenly Father
loves each of us, he has provided us with a source of comfort and strength--
the scriptures.

My dear friends, I am thankful for this opportunity to share with you my
experience with the scriptures.

While growing up, I was blessed to come from a home where scriptures were an
important part of our lives. I had gone to many Church activities and heard
friends and family bear testimony of the power of the scriptures. I had a
desire to gain a personal testimony of the power and truthfulness of the
scriptures.

But that did not happen easily. Because of my learning disability, it was hard
to read the words and even more difficult to understand them. I often felt
embarrassed and frustrated. I didn't like to go to Young Women because I felt
inadequate. I was afraid I might be called on to read. I felt more comfortable
with my family, but I continued to feel frustrated.

I prayed for help and I found this scripture. Please turn with me to Moroni
7:33 [[Moro.
7:33](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.33?lang=eng#32)], and I will
share with you my answer: "And Christ hath said: If ye will have faith in me
ye shall have power to do whatsoever thing is expedient in me."

What a wonderful promise! If I would put my faith in the Lord, he would help
me. He would help me to understand the scriptures. This was the key for me.
One verse at a time, one day at a time, I began to understand. Even my
schoolwork improved. The Book of Mormon got me through high school. I still
have my learning disability and face challenges every day, but daily scripture
study reminds me to have faith in my Heavenly Father.

No matter where you live or what kind of family you come from, Heavenly Father
loves you and will be there to help and strengthen you whenever you need him.
I know this because he has been there for me. I love my family, who understand
the challenges I have. I'm grateful for leaders who have worked with me. I
know the Church is true. I know the scriptures are there for each of us to
learn from. I know that Christ lives. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
