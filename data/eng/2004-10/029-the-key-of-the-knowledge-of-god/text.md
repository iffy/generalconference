# The Key of the Knowledge of God

Brethren of the priesthood of God, I am again seated as I deliver my message
this evening. As you are aware, I am working through a temporary back problem.
Those of you who have had back trouble will understand. Those of you who
haven't--just wait a while! Any other explanation of what ails me is not true!

I humbly speak to you tonight with a prayer in my heart that you may
understand me by the power of the Spirit. It is hard to imagine anything more
important for us as priesthood holders to learn than the key of the knowledge
of God. This evening I would like to speak concerning that key.

The greater priesthood administers the gospel and holds "the key of the
mysteries of the kingdom, even the key of the knowledge of God." [1]  What is
the key of the knowledge of God, and can anyone obtain it? Without the
priesthood there can be no fulness of the knowledge of God. The Prophet Joseph
Smith said that the "Melchizedek Priesthood ... is the channel through which all
knowledge, doctrine, the plan of salvation and every important matter is
revealed from heaven." [2]  President Joseph F. Smith stated: "One who can
truly affirm that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, and Jesus is the Savior,
has in his possession a prize beyond computation. When we know this we know
God, and we have a key to all knowledge." [3]

Father Abraham recognized the value of this grand key as he recounted his
experience: "I sought for the blessings of the fathers, and the right
whereunto I should be ordained to administer the same; having been myself a
follower of righteousness, desiring also to be one who possessed great
knowledge, and to be a greater follower of righteousness, and to possess a
greater knowledge, ... and desiring to receive instructions, and to keep the
commandments of God, I became a rightful heir, a High Priest, holding the
right belonging to the fathers." [4]

Anyone who is righteous and desires to possess greater knowledge and to become
"a greater follower of righteousness" can, under the authority of the
priesthood, obtain a greater knowledge of God. The Lord tells us one clear way
to do so, as given in the Doctrine and Covenants: "If thou shalt ask, thou
shalt receive revelation upon revelation, knowledge upon knowledge, ... that
which bringeth joy, that which bringeth life eternal." [5]

One might ask, "How do I become a greater follower of righteousness?" A
righteous person is one who makes and keeps gospel covenants. These are holy
contracts, [6]  usually between individuals and the Lord. Sometimes they
include other persons, such as spouses. They involve most sacred promises and
commitments, such as baptism, the conferral of the priesthood, temple
blessings, marriage, and parenthood. Many of the blessings of Father Abraham
come as the Holy Ghost is poured out upon all people. [7]  Any worthy man or
woman who receives the Holy Ghost can actually become "a new creation." [8]

To obtain the full portion of these supernal blessings and come to a full
knowledge of God, a man must enter into and keep the oath and covenant of the
priesthood. [9]  President Marion G. Romney insightfully pointed out:

"The only way a man can make the maximum progress towards eternal life, for
which mortality is designed, is to obtain and magnify the Melchizedek
Priesthood. ... It is of utmost importance that we keep clearly in mind what the
magnifying of our callings in the priesthood requires of us. ... It requires at
least the following three things:

"1\. That we obtain a knowledge of the gospel.

"2\. That we comply in our personal living with the standards of the gospel.

"3\. That we give dedicated service." [10]

Two covenants are to be made by each priesthood holder. The first is to be
faithful unto the obtaining of the Aaronic and Melchizedek Priesthoods. [11]
The Aaronic Priesthood trains and prepares the priesthood holder for the
greater duties of the Melchizedek Priesthood and prepares him to receive the
blessings of the oath and covenant of the priesthood. Holding both the Aaronic
and Melchizedek Priesthoods is essential to receive the full blessings that
the Lord has for His faithful sons. The second covenant as His agent in this
holy authority is to be faithful in magnifying one's calling with total faith
in God. [12]

As part of the oath and covenant of the priesthood, the Lord makes several
promises to His faithful sons "which he cannot break." [13]  First, the
priesthood holders "are sanctified by the Spirit unto the renewing of their
bodies." [14]  I think President Hinckley is a great example of this. He has
been renewed in body, mind, and spirit in a most remarkable manner. Second,
"they become the sons of Moses and of Aaron and the seed of Abraham." [15]
Third, they become "the elect of God." [16]  As His agents, they carry forth
this holy work in our time on the earth. Fourth, "all they who receive this
priesthood receive [the Lord]." [17]  Fifth, those who receive the Lord's
servants receive Him. [18]  Sixth, those who receive the Savior receive God
the Father. [19]  Seventh, they also receive the Father's kingdom. [20]
Eighth, they also shall be given all that the Father hath. [21]  Those who
receive all that the Father hath can receive nothing more.

You young men of the Aaronic Priesthood have been given great authority and
responsibilities. Under the direction of the bishop, the Aaronic Priesthood
functions in at least two ordinances that are directly related to the
Atonement. One is the sacrament, which is in remembrance of the Savior's blood
shed for our sins and His body which He gave as a ransom for us. [22]  The
second is baptism. Priests have authority to perform baptisms for the
remission of sins. The Aaronic Priesthood is a very real power. One young man
wrote this of his experience in exercising this power:

"At one time I attended a ward which had almost no Melchizedek Priesthood
holders in it. But it was not in any way dulled in spirituality. On the
contrary, many of its members witnessed the greatest display of priesthood
power they had ever known.

"The power was centered in the priests. For the first time in their lives they
were called upon to perform all the duties of the priests and administer to
the needs of their fellow ward members. They were seriously called to home
teach--not just to be a yawning appendage to an elder making a social call but
to bless their brothers and sisters.

"Previous to this time I had been with four of these priests in a different
situation. ... They drove away every seminary teacher after two or three months.
They spread havoc over the countryside on Scouting trips. _But when they were
needed--when they were trusted with a vital mission--they were among those who
shone the most brilliantly in priesthood service._

"The secret was that the bishop called upon his Aaronic Priesthood to rise to
the stature of men to whom angels might well appear; and they rose to that
stature, administering relief to those who might be in want and strengthening
those who needed strengthening. Not only were the other ward members built up
but so were the members of the quorum themselves. A great unity spread
throughout the ward and every member began to have a taste of what it is for a
people to be of one mind and one heart. There was nothing inexplicable in all
of this; it was just the proper exercise of the Aaronic Priesthood." [23]

President Gordon B. Hinckley recently told the Aaronic Priesthood that those
of you who live worthy lives can be blessed by the "protection of ministering
angels" and that you "have something magnificent to live up to." [24]

What does it mean to be the seed of Abraham? Scripturally it has a deeper
meaning than being his literal descendants. The Lord made a covenant with
Abraham, the great patriarch, that all nations would be blessed through him.
[25]  Any man or woman can claim the blessings of Abraham. They become his
seed and heirs to the promised blessings by accepting the gospel, being
baptized, entering into temple marriage, being faithful in keeping their
covenants, and helping to carry the gospel to all the nations of the earth.

To be empowered to "bear this ministry and Priesthood unto all nations," [26]
a man must receive the Melchizedek Priesthood with its blessings. Then through
faithfulness he becomes an heir to the fulness of eternal life. For as Paul
said, "And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according
to the promise." [27]

As the seed of Abraham, we have some obligations. We are commanded to come to
Christ by doing "the works of Abraham." [28]  These works include obeying God,
receiving and keeping priesthood and temple ordinances and covenants,
preaching the gospel, building a family unit and teaching our children, and
being faithful to the end.

It is interesting that the Lord used the word _seed_ in His promise to
Abraham. It has a fuller meaning than posterity because it means to multiply
the blessings of the covenant of Abraham "unto all nations." [29]  The Lord
promised Abraham a posterity "as innumerable as the stars" or "the sand upon
the seashore." [30]

Abraham's righteous posterity is also privileged to be adopted into the
eternal family of Jesus Christ. This includes the right to receive eternal
covenants in the temple by which, if they are worthy, they will be organized
and exalted in the eternal family of Christ. [31]  It also includes "the
blessings of salvation, even of life eternal." [32]

The patriarchal order runs from Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob. Through the
line of the priesthood it continues in our own day and time. Through the ages,
blessings and promises were given from the fathers to their faithful sons. A
modern example of this is taken from the life of Elder John B. Dickson of the
Seventy. He recalls:

"When it was time for me to go on a mission, I was very excited to serve the
Lord. Just before I was to leave, however, I found out that I had bone cancer.
The chance of living long enough to serve a mission wasn't very high. I had
faith that the Lord would provide a way if He wanted me to go. My father gave
me a blessing in which I was told that I would serve my mission in Mexico,
serve in the Church all my life, and have a family. My right arm had to be
amputated above the elbow, but my life was spared, and the promises I was
given have all been fulfilled.

"Some would think that losing an arm would be a terrible burden, but it has
been one of the greatest blessings in my life. I learned that it is very
important to have challenges and to face up to them."

Elder Dickson had always been right-handed, and now he had to learn to do
everything left-handed. One struggle was learning how to tie his ties. He
said: "One Sunday morning when I was in my bedroom with my tie in my hand, I
thought, _How am I going to tie this?_ I thought about getting a clip-on tie.
I thought about asking Mom to help me. But I couldn't take her with me on my
mission just to tie my ties. So I decided I had to learn how to do it myself.
I finally figured it out by using my teeth. I still do it that way, even after
having tied it thousands of times." [33]

We don't know in detail all that is going to be required of humanity, of the
Saints of God in the uncertain days ahead. Everyday righteous living will be
increasingly difficult. In addition, holders of the priesthood may well have
to meet some extra challenges in safeguarding and providing for their
families. As one world leader recently pointed out, there will be "dangers
common to us all. Today's deadly threats come from rogue powers and stateless
networks of extremists who have nothing but contempt for the sanctity of human
life and for the principles civilized nations hold dear." [34]

We can all expect to face trials. But great eternal promises are extended to
those who persist in righteousness. The Lord has given His word that "any man
that shall ... fail not to continue faithful in all things, shall not be weary
in mind, neither darkened, neither in body, limb, nor joint. ... And they shall
not go hungry, neither athirst." [35]  I am optimistic about what the future
holds for the Lord's Church and its members, but we will have to persist in
righteousness and be "faithful in all things." [36]  The key of the knowledge
of God, administered by those who keep the oath and covenant of the
Melchizedek Priesthood, will enable us to come off as the sons of God. That we
will do so, I pray humbly in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
