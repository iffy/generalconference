# Why Do Latter-day Saints Build Temples?

It was a pleasure for me to sustain Brother Harold B. Lee as the President of
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and to sustain all of the
other General Authorities this morning.

I wish to express appreciation for that sustaining vote in my behalf and
pledge to all my leaders here my full support. I am willing to do all that is
required of me to help build up the kingdom of the Lord upon the earth.

A question that is often asked by many and comes to the minds of many who are
not members of our faith is: "Why do Latter-day Saints build temples?"

Our third Article of Faith is: "We believe that through the Atonement of
Christ, all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of
the Gospel." [[A of F
1:3](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.3?lang=eng#2)]

The fourth Article of Faith follows: "We believe that the first principles and
ordinances of the Gospel are: first, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second,
Repentance; third, Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; fourth,
Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost." [[A of F
1:4](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.4?lang=eng#3)]

With God, all laws and ordinances must be complied with and obeyed. Christ
said to Nicodemus, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born
again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.

"Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter
the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?

"Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of
water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." ([John
3:3-5](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/3.3-5?lang=eng#2).)

Christ had already confirmed the fullness and exactness of this law in his own
compliance thereto, as recorded in Matthew: "Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to
Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.

"But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest
thou to me?

"And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it
becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him." ([Matt.
3:13-15](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/3.13-15?lang=eng#12).)

Baptism, then, is for _all _mankind, even Christ, the very Son of God, who was
perfect and without sin. Then it is all the more necessary for all of _us._

If required for all mankind, then would a just God condemn for all eternity
those who came to the earth at such time when, and such places where, such
opportunities were not available--hence, impossible for them to comply with
the law?

Then if God is just, and we know he is, he must provide a way whereby all
mankind may receive his ordinances, and they must be so performed as shall be
accepted by him.

Peter tells us in his First Epistle that between the time of Christ's
crucifixion and his resurrection, he was actively engaged in preaching to the
spirits of those who had died:

"By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;

"Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in
the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight
souls were saved by water." ([1 Pet.
3:19-20](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-pet/3.19-20?lang=eng#18).)

This opened the way for all who did not have the opportunity to accept his
gospel in this life to accept it after death. This does not provide the
ordinance of baptism, which is a must for entrance into the kingdom of God.

Paul, preaching to the Corinthians, trying to convert them to the reality of a
resurrection, asked them, "Else what shall they do which are baptized for the
dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?"
([1 Cor. 15:29](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15.29?lang=eng#28).)

Obviously, they were then practicing a vicarious ordinance of baptism for
their kindred dead.

Christ suffered vicariously for us; now he is giving us the opportunity to
perform a vicarious act for our fellowmen.

There are yet other requirements needed. How can this vicarious work be done
if the names of those who have died are not known?

The necessity, then, is very apparent that records must be kept, researched,
and obtained to do this work for each individual, separately.

In April 1836, at the completion of the temple in Kirtland, Ohio, several
heavenly messengers appeared to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery. Note--not to
Joseph Smith alone, but to Joseph and Oliver. Two witnessed these visitations.
Among them was Elijah the prophet, who ascended into heaven without tasting
death.

Thirteen years earlier, Joseph Smith had been promised by a heavenly messenger
by the name of Moroni that Elijah would be sent to him. The Prophet Joseph
Smith described the keys Elijah bestowed upon them in these words:

"The spirit, power, and calling of Elijah is, that ye have power to hold the
keys of the revelation, ordinances, oracles, powers, and endowments of the
fullness of the Melchizedek Priesthood and of the kingdom of God on the earth:
and to receive, obtain, and perform _all _the ordinances belonging to the
kingdom of God, even unto the turning of the hearts of the fathers unto the
children, and the hearts of the children unto their fathers, even those who
are in heaven." (_Documentary History of the Church, _vol. 6, p. 251. Italics
added.)

Our forefathers who did not have this opportunity were promised that this day
would come. (See [D&amp;C 121:26-27](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-
testament/dc/121.26-27?lang=eng#25).)

Since the coming of Elijah the prophet to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery in
the Kirtland Temple, this work of gathering the names has taken on great
proportions by people of all walks of life and in many nations. This is a
miraculous undertaking. Think of the way the Lord has inspired the scientific
minds of our day to provide machines of all kinds to speed up and make
possible this great undertaking.

Five years after Elijah's coming, in a revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith
in 1841, the Lord directed his people to "build a house to my name, for the
Most High to dwell therein.

"For there is not a place found on earth that he may come to and restore again
that which was lost unto you, or which he hath taken away, even the fulness of
the priesthood.

"For a baptismal font there is not upon the earth, that they, my saints, may
be baptized for those who are dead--

"For this ordinance belongeth to my house, and cannot be acceptable to me,
only in the days of your poverty, wherein ye are not able to build a house
unto me." ([D&amp;C 124:27-30](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-
testament/dc/124.27-30?lang=eng#26).)

Then he tells of other sacred ordinances that are to be performed in his
house, or a temple.

Thus it is necessary to build temples, houses of the Lord, sacred edifices in
which may be performed the ordinance of baptism and other sacred ordinances
vicariously for our dead ancestors.

Elijah brought the keys to perform _all _the sacred ordinances belonging to
the kingdom of God. All these most sacred ordinances necessary for man's
exaltation in the life to come, even eternal life, are accepted by God only
when they are performed in his sacred house, a temple of God.

For this reason, the children of Israel constructed an "ark of the covenant,"
which was portable, so they might have the blessings of the kingdom of God.

To receive the fullness of the blessings of exaltation, even eternal life, man
must receive _all _the law and the ordinances of God's kingdom.

Another requirement to fulfill all the law is _people._ We, as members of the
Church, must so live as to be worthy to go into the house of the Lord to
perform these most sacred ordinances, first for ourselves, then for our dead
ancestors.

The living come first. It is necessary for us to receive these ordinances
first; then we may be privileged to do this work for our ancestors, to whom
the promise was made that we would come to earth in this the dispensation of
the fulness of times to do this work for them.

The time must come when temples will be found all over the earth, in many
nations. This is most necessary for the salvation, exaltation, and eternal
life of man. Then we should all be very diligent in gathering the family
records and so live to be worthy of taking part in this work.

I pray the Lord to bless us to do this work, in the name of Jesus Christ.
Amen.
