# Church Auditing Department Report, 2009

Dear Brethren: As prescribed by revelation in section 120 of the Doctrine and
Covenants, the Council on the Disposition of the Tithes authorizes the
expenditure of Church funds. This council is composed of the First Presidency,
the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and the Presiding Bishopric. This council
approves budgets for Church departments and operations. Church departments
expend funds consistent with approved budgets and in accordance with Church
policies and procedures.

The Church Auditing Department has been granted access to all records and
systems necessary to evaluate the adequacy of controls over receipts of funds,
expenditures, and safeguarding of Church assets. The Church Auditing
Department is independent of all other Church departments and operations, and
the staff consists of certified public accountants, certified internal
auditors, certified information systems auditors, and other credentialed
professionals.

Based upon audits performed, the Church Auditing Department is of the opinion
that, in all material respects, contributions received, expenditures made, and
assets of the Church for the year 2009 have been recorded and administered in
accordance with appropriate accounting practices, approved budgets, and Church
policies and procedures.

Respectfully submitted,

RobertW. Cantwell

Managing Director
