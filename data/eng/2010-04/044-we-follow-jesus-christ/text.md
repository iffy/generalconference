# We Follow Jesus Christ

It is a significant responsibility to speak on Easter Sunday to Latter-day
Saints across the world, who love our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. We
celebrate this morning His victory over death. We cherish our understanding
and feel heartfelt appreciation for the Savior's willing atoning sacrifice on
our behalf. His acquiescence to the will of His Father won the supernal
victory over death and is the transcendent event in the history of mankind. I
appreciate this opportunity to speak about following the Savior.

The final two days of the Savior's mortal ministry prior to His Crucifixion
are profoundly important and in some ways beyond comprehension. So much of
what is essential to our eternal destiny occurred on Thursday and then Friday,
the day Christ was crucified. The Last Supper, a Passover supper, the
"established memorial of Israel's deliverance from bondage," was commenced
Thursday evening. [1]  Ordinances and doctrines of great importance were
initiated at the Last Supper. I will mention just three. First, the Savior
introduced the ordinance of the sacrament. He took bread, broke it, prayed
over it, and passed it to His disciples, saying, "This is my body which is
given for you: this do in remembrance of me." [2]  In this manner He
instituted the sacrament. Second, His overwhelming emphasis was on doctrines
teaching love as a preeminent principle. He taught, "By this shall all men
know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another." [3]  Third,
through Christ's intercession or direction, "the Holy Ghost was promised to
the apostles" as another Comforter. [4]

The Savior subsequently accomplished the Atonement. He took upon Himself the
"burden of the sins of mankind" and the "horrors that Satan ... could inflict."
[5]  In this process He endured the fraudulently concocted trials and the
terrible, tragic events leading to His Crucifixion. This ultimately culminated
in Christ's triumphant Resurrection on Easter Sunday. Christ fulfilled His
sacred mission as Savior and Redeemer. We will be resurrected from death and
have our spirits reunited with our bodies. Based on personal worthiness, we
may through His grace have the glorious opportunity of entering back into the
presence of God. [6]

The Prophet Joseph Smith, speaking of these Easter events, said, "The
fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and
Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried, and rose again
the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all other things which pertain to
our religion are only appendages to it." [7]

While we rejoice in the supernal significance of Gethsemane and Calvary, our
focus has always been on the resurrected Lord. Frederic Farrar, the English
theologian and believer, testified that the earliest generation of believers
in the primitive Christian Church celebrated the Savior as "the Risen, the
Eternal, the Glorified Christ" and "contemplated Him, not as on the Cross, but
as on the Throne." [8]

President Gordon B. Hinckley taught that our message to the world is that He
lives! The symbol of Christ for the Latter-day Saints will be found in the
meaningful expression of our faith and the way we live His gospel. [9]

As we ponder what it means to be Christians today, think about what our path
of discipleship will require of us. I suggest that we contemplate and in
appropriate ways emulate what the Savior did in those last two days of His
mortal life.

First, consider the Savior's introduction of the sacrament. The Savior knew
what was about to befall Him. His sacred, atoning mission, beginning with the
War in Heaven in the premortal existence, was about to unfold that evening and
the next day. Yet with the trials by His adversaries imminently before Him,
there is not the slightest evidence He was preparing a defense against the
untrue accusations. The Savior instead introduced the sacred ordinance of the
sacrament to His disciples. As I contemplate that solemn occasion, my feelings
are deeply touched. Sacrament meeting is the most sacred and holy of all the
meetings in the Church. After His Resurrection, the Savior instituted the
sacrament among the Nephites. [10]  If we are to be His disciples and to be
committed members of His Church, we must remember and reverence the sacrament.
It allows each of us to express with broken hearts and contrite spirits our
willingness to follow the Savior, to repent, and to become a Saint through the
Atonement of Christ. [11]  The sacrament allows us to witness to God that we
will remember His Son and keep His commandments as we renew our baptismal
covenant. [12]  This increases our love and appreciation for both the Father
and the Son.

The Savior also emphasized love and unity and declared that we would be known
as His disciples if we have love one to another. In the face of the eternity-
shaping Atonement He was about to undertake, such a commandment requires our
obedience. We manifest our love for God when we keep His commandments and
serve His children. We don't fully comprehend the Atonement, but we can spend
our lives trying to be more loving and kind, regardless of the adversity we
face.

The Savior's charge to His disciples to love one another--and the dramatic and
powerful way He taught this principle at the Last Supper--is one of the most
poignant and beautiful episodes from the last days of His mortal life.

He was not teaching a simple class in ethical behavior. This was the Son of
God pleading with His Apostles and all disciples who would come after them to
remember and follow this most central of His teachings. How we relate and
interact with each other is a measure of our willingness to follow Jesus
Christ.

As we listen to the messages of this conference, we will be touched in our
hearts and make resolutions and commitments to do better. But on Monday
morning we will return to work, school, neighborhoods, and to a world that in
many cases is in turmoil. Many in this world are afraid and angry with one
another. While we understand these feelings, we need to be civil in our
discourse and respectful in our interactions. This is especially true when we
disagree. The Savior taught us to love even our enemies. [13]  The vast
majority of our members heed this counsel. Yet there are some who feel that
venting their personal anger or deeply held opinions is more important than
conducting themselves as Jesus Christ lived and taught. I invite each one of
us individually to recognize that how we disagree is a real measure of who we
are and whether we truly follow the Savior. It is appropriate to disagree, but
it is not appropriate to be disagreeable. Violence and vandalism are not the
answer to our disagreements. If we show love and respect even in adverse
circumstances, we become more like Christ.

The Savior's promise of the Holy Ghost to the Apostles is of supreme
importance in recognizing the preeminent role of the Holy Ghost, the third
member of the Godhead. The Holy Ghost is a personage of spirit, the Comforter,
who bears witness of the Father and the Son, reveals the truth of all things,
and sanctifies those who have repented and been baptized. He is referred to as
the Holy Spirit of Promise and as such confirms as acceptable to God the
righteous acts, ordinances, and covenants of each of us. [14]  They who are
sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise receive all that the Father has. [15]

We live in a noisy, contentious world, where it is possible to be viewing or
listening to information, music, or even pure nonsense virtually every waking
hour. If we want to have the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, we must find time
to slow down, ponder, pray, and live so we are worthy to receive and act upon
His promptings. We will avoid major mistakes if we heed His warnings. It is
our privilege as members to receive light and knowledge from Him even to the
perfect day. [16]

The atoning trials the Savior faced in Gethsemane and on the cross are a great
example to us. He faced mental, physical, and spiritual afflictions that are
beyond our comprehension. In the garden, He prayed to His Father, saying, "O
my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I
will, but as thou wilt." [17]  As His disciples, there will be times when we
will be tried and persecuted unjustly and mocked unfairly and face temporal
and spiritual storms of a magnitude that will seem unbearable to us and
experience bitter cups that we pray would pass from us. No one is exempt from
the storms of life.

We are preparing for the Second Coming of the Savior. The scriptures are clear
that no one knows when this will occur. The scriptures do tell us that in the
last days, among the bitter cups we will face, there will be "earthquakes, in
divers places" [18]  and the "waves of the sea heaving themselves beyond their
bounds." [19]

Devastating earthquakes and tsunamis have recently occurred in diverse places,
including Chile, Haiti, and the islands of the Pacific. A few weeks ago
Presiding Bishop H. David Burton, Elder Tad R. Callister, and I were able to
meet with the Saints who had lost family members as a result of the tsunami
that hit the eastern side of Samoa last September. The chapel was full, and it
was an emotional meeting. We were able to assure these choice members that
because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ, they can be reunited with the loved
ones they have lost.

The stake president, Sonny Purcell, was driving his car when he saw the
enormous wave coming far out at sea. He honked his horn and stopped children
on the road walking to school and warned them to run for higher ground and
safety as fast as they could. The children followed his instruction. He
frantically drove, reached his four-year-old daughter, put her in the car, and
then tried to get to his mother. Before he could reach his mother, the wall of
water picked up his car and swept it over 100 yards (91 m), where it lodged in
a tree. He scrambled to secure his daughter on top of the car and then swam to
rescue his mother, who was clinging to a branch of another tree near their
house. With great effort he swam with her to the car and safety. Many were not
as fortunate. They did not have time to get to higher ground and safety. Many
lost their lives, particularly the young and the elderly.

We told the Samoan families that members all over the world expressed love and
concern and had prayed for them and contributed fast offerings and
humanitarian aid for both the members and their neighbors. The same is true
for the members and their neighbors in Chile and Haiti. We do this because we
follow Jesus Christ.

As we met with the families in Samoa, the significance of spiritually going to
the higher ground, living a better life, and clinging to saving ordinances was
abundantly clear. The Savior's example and life teach us to spiritually avoid
the low pathway, where the things of this world dominate. As I shook hands
with the members after our meeting, one sister told me her family had not been
to the temple and they had lost a daughter. She tearfully said their goal now
was to prepare themselves for the sacred ordinances of the temple so they can
be together eternally.

As I have pondered what this sister said and the current condition of the
world, I have felt an urgency to counsel each of us to seek the higher ground
--the refuge and eternal protection of the temple.

On Easter Sunday, April 3, 1836, one week after the dedication of the Kirtland
Temple, the Twelve officiated in distributing the sacrament of the Lord's
Supper to the members. After the meeting, following solemn and silent prayer,
the Savior appeared in majesty to the Prophet Joseph and Oliver Cowdery and
through Moses, Elias, and Elijah ushered in the restoration of additional
priesthood keys, including the sacred sealing power that unites families
throughout eternity. [20]

Today on this Easter morning we rejoice in all the Savior has done for us. He
has made it possible for each of us to gain our salvation and exaltation. But
we, like the Samoan children, must run as fast as we can to the high ground He
has provided for safety and peace.

One of the ways we do this is by adhering to the teachings of our living
prophet, President Thomas S. Monson. He is an excellent example of one who
follows the Savior.

On this glorious Easter morning I resonate with the treasured words penned by
Eliza R. Snow, a faithful servant in the Restoration:

_How great, how glorious, how complete,_

_Redemption's grand design,_

_Where justice, love, and mercy meet_

_In harmony divine!_ [21]

I bear my apostolic witness that Jesus Christ lives and is the Savior and
Redeemer of the world. He has provided the pathway to true happiness. Of this
I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
