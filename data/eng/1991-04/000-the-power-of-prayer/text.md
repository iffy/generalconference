# The Power of Prayer

My beloved brothers and sisters, it has been customary for the President of
the Church to welcome you and deliver a message at the commencement of
conference. With all his noble heart, President Benson would desire to stand
at this pulpit and bear to you his witness concerning the truth of this work,
the gratitude he feels for your prayers, and his fervent hope that all may so
live as to merit and receive the abundant blessings a loving Heavenly Father
desires to bestow.

Tears come easily to the eyes of our prophet when he receives letters written
by children in which they express their greetings and send to him their love.
President Benson is a family man who loves his children, grandchildren, and
great-grandchildren and, indeed, children everywhere in this wonderful world
in which we live.

President Benson has suggested that I begin this conference with a brief
message in his behalf. He is pleased that the president of the United States
has proclaimed that yesterday, today, and tomorrow be designated as days of
national prayer and that sincere expressions of gratitude ascend to heaven for
the end of the war in the Middle East. The First Presidency has commented: "We
are thankful for the resolution of the war, and it is our fervent hope and
prayer that all nations involved will work in concert for a lasting peace. The
collective prayers of the nation and the world should focus not only on a
lasting peace but also on the needs of the many on both sides who lost loved
ones and endured suffering in the conflict."

President Benson has stated: "The price of peace is righteousness. Men and
nations may loudly proclaim, 'Peace, peace,' but there shall be no peace until
individuals nurture in their souls those principles of personal purity,
integrity, and character which foster the development of peace. Peace cannot
be imposed. It must come from the lives and hearts of men. There is no other
way." (_The Teachings of Ezra Taft Benson_ Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1988, p.
703.)

President Benson has urged: "If we would advance in holiness--increase in
favor with God--nothing can take the place of prayer. ... Give prayer--daily
prayer, secret prayer--a foremost place in your lives. Let no day pass without
it. Communion with the Almighty has been a source of strength, inspiration,
and enlightenment through the world's history to men and women who have shaped
the destinies of individuals and nations for good." (_God, Family, Country:
Our Three Great Loyalties,_ Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1974, p. 8.)

In speaking to a large audience in Sao Paulo, Brazil, some time ago, President
Benson testified:

"All through my life the counsel to depend on prayer has been prized above
almost any other advice I have ever received. It has become an integral part
of me, an anchor, a constant source of strength and the basis of my knowledge
of things divine.

"Our Heavenly Father is always near. ... Thank God we can reach out and tap that
unseen power, without which no man can do his best." (Message delivered to
temple workers and Church employees at Sao Paulo, Brazil, 20 November 1982.)

President Benson has frequently quoted the words of a favorite hymn:

_Prayer is the soul's sincere desire,_

_Uttered or unexpressed,_

_The motion of a hidden fire_

_That trembles in the breast._

_Prayer is the burden of a sigh,_

_The falling of a tear,_

_The upward glancing of an eye_

_When none but God is near. ..._

_O thou by whom we come to God,_

_The Life, the Truth, the Way!_

_The path of prayer thyself hast trod;_

_Lord, teach us how to pray._

The words of testimony spoken by President Benson are particularly appropriate
on this special day of prayer and thanksgiving. He said: "I testify that there
is a God in heaven who hears and answers prayers. I know this to be true, for
He has answered mine. I would humbly urge all within the sound of my voice to
keep in close touch with our Father in Heaven, through prayer." (Message, Sao
Paulo, Brazil, 20 November 1982.)

I heartily endorse this plea of our prophet and President, in the name of
Jesus Christ, amen.
