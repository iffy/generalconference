# Who’s on the Lord’s Team?

Major league teams hire scouts whose job it is to continually survey the young
upcoming players. Their trained eyes look for players who have consistently
superior performances. It is not by chance that these young men are singled
out from the rest. There is much preparation that goes into the attaining of
excellence.

Such an athlete spends many years in training, trying to perfect every part of
his performance. He exercises for long hours. He is careful to eat nutritional
foods that build muscle tone, recognizing that what he takes into his body
will have an effect upon his physical stamina. He obtains the proper amount of
rest and observes other health laws. Attaining physical excellence in his life
has been given top priority. Daily, weekly, and yearly goals are set and given
great dedication. He listens carefully to his coach, who watches every
movement he makes and knows his performance better than he does. Together they
study videotapes of his plays and even analyze the minute details of his
abilities through the graphics of a computer. He is careful to keep up with
any new innovation or philosophy. As he retires at night, his thoughts turn
once again to scrutinizing his performance with an ever-constant vision of the
day when he will receive an invitation to become a member of one of those
elite teams that constitute the world of professional athletics.

We sing a hymn, "Who's on the Lord's side?" What does the word _side_ mean?
The definition of the word _side_ is one of the contesting parties in a game
or sport; one of a group of players; a _team._

Based on this definition, the question "Who's on the Lord's _side?_" could
appropriately be rephrased "Who's on the Lord's _team?_" Some of the lyrics
that might be appropriately applied to the priesthood are:

_Who's on the Lord's team? Who?_

_ Now is the time to show;_

_We ask it fearlessly:_

_ Who's on the Lord's team? Who?_

... ... .

_We serve the living God,_

_ And want his foes to know_

_That if but few, we're great;_

_ Who's on the Lord's team? Who?_

We're going on to win,

Nor fear must blanch the brow;

The Lord of hosts is ours;

Who's on the Lord's team? Who?

Serving on the Lord's team does not happen by chance. President Spencer W.
Kimball has told us, "This is something we are heir to; we were born to it,
and all we need to do is qualify for it to obtain this blessing."
(_Priesthood,_ Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1981, p. 2.)

In [Alma 13:1](/scriptures/bofm/alma/13.1?lang=eng#0) we learn that "the Lord
God ordained priests, after his holy order."

In verses 3 and 4 [[Alma 13:3-4](/scriptures/bofm/alma/13.3-4?lang=eng#2)] we
are told that "this is the manner after which they were ordained--being called
and prepared from the foundation of the world according to the foreknowledge
of God, on account of their exceeding faith and good works; in the first place
being left to choose good or evil; therefore they have chosen good, and
exercising exceedingly great faith, are called with a holy calling. ...

"And thus they have been called to this holy calling on account of their
faith, while others would reject the Spirit of God on account of the hardness
of their hearts and blindness of their minds, while, if it had not been for
this they might have had as great privilege as their brethren."

In [Alma 13:9](/scriptures/bofm/alma/13.9?lang=eng#8) we are told, "Thus they
become high priests forever."

As you participate on a basketball team, or are part of a drama presentation,
or sing in a quartet, or join a Scout troop, you are aware that membership in
these groups usually lasts just a few months, or at most a few years. As there
is a beginning to participation in these groups, there is also an end. And
yet, as Alma taught us, we are high priests forever. The priesthood is
eternal.

Now, you young men, let's carefully consider some examples from the lives of
our prophets as they have spiritually prepared for the priesthood. President
Joseph Fielding Smith shares with us his feelings in these words: "'When I was
a small boy, too young to hold the Aaronic Priesthood, my father placed a copy
of the Book of Mormon in my hands with the request that I read it. I received
this Nephite record with thanksgiving and applied myself to the task which had
been assigned to me. There are certain passages that have been stamped upon my
mind and I have never forgotten them.' By the time he was ten years old he had
read the Book of Mormon through not just once but twice. His brothers
remembered of his hurrying to get through his chores as quickly as possible,
and sometimes even leaving a ball game early, and secluding himself in the
hayloft or in the shade of a tree to get back to his reading of the book."
(Joseph Fielding Smith, Jr., and John J. Stewart, _The Life of Joseph Fielding
Smith,_ Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1972, p. 57.)

President David O. McKay tells: "I remember as a deacon chopping wood for the
widows on Saturday. We met as a group of nine boys, held a short meeting, took
our axes, went to the widows, and chopped enough wood for each to last that
week."

And President McKay continues: "As a priest, I recall administering the
sacrament and my failure the first time I offered the prayer. We did not have
the prayer on a printed card before us then as is frequently the case now. We
were supposed to memorize it. The sacrament table was just under the pulpit,
and my father, the bishop, always stood right over the one who asked the
blessing upon the bread and water. I thought I knew the prayer, but I had
memorized it privately, and when I knelt and saw the congregation before me, I
became flustered." (_Cherished Experiences,_ comp. Clare Middlemiss, Salt Lake
City: Deseret Book Co., 1976, p. 190.) This challenge did not cause him to
become discouraged, my young friends. He made additional preparation and
lifted himself to a level of excellence.

President Kimball recites the following story about a goal he made when he was
still a young boy: "When I heard a Church leader from Salt Lake City tell us
at conference that we should read the scriptures, and I recognized that I had
never read the Bible, that very night at the conclusion of that very sermon I
walked to my home a block away and climbed up in my little attic room in the
top of the house and lighted a little coal-oil lamp that was on the little
table, and I read the first chapters of Genesis. A year later I closed the
Bible, having read every chapter in that big and glorious book.

"I found that this Bible that I was reading had in it 66 books, and then I was
nearly dissuaded when I found that it had in it 1,189 chapters, and then I
also found that it had 1,519 pages. It was formidable, but I knew if others
did it that I could do it.

"I found that there were certain parts that were hard for a 14-year-old boy to
understand. There were some pages that were not especially interesting to me,
but when I had read the 66 books and 1,189 chapters and 1,519 pages, I had a
glowing satisfaction that I had made a goal and that I had achieved it.

And he continues: "I am not telling you this story to boast; I am merely using
this as an example to say that if I could do it by coal-oil light, you can do
it by electric light. I have always been glad I read the Bible from cover to
cover." (_Ensign, _May 1974, p. 88.)

Nearly every week I attend a stake conference somewhere in the world, so I am
not able to attend the Gospel Doctrine class in my ward where the Book of
Mormon is being taught this year. It really pained me to miss this privilege
of catching the spirit of this very sacred other testament that Jesus is the
Christ. So my wife and I set a goal to study the Book of Mormon at home. We
determined to finish the 1984 course of study for the Gospel Doctrine class
before this April general conference. We began in January; and on Monday,
March 12, we finished the last of the forty-six lessons of the Book of Mormon
course. It really felt good to accomplish this goal.

You young men from all over the world are preparing to become members of a
team. You have looked forward to this day with great anticipation. Hands have
been laid upon your head to bestow the priesthood of God, in the name of Jesus
Christ, that you might stand in His place in administering the sacred
ordinances to the children of men. Think about it for a minute.

My companions in the priesthood, I love you with all my heart; the General
Authorities all love you. We would invite you to spiritually exercise each
day. This you would do at the level of your choosing. For example, read the
Book of Mormon a few verses a day, or a chapter a day, fifteen minutes a day,
or thirty minutes a day. You will know the amount of spiritual tone that you
need to gain. You can accept this challenge, can't you?

You've made the team, the Lord's team, because of your superior, dedicated
performance. What a privilege is now yours as you _exercise_ with service and
love, _build your endurance_ as you prayerfully confront life's challenges,
and _partake of nutritional spiritual food_ as you read and ponder the
scriptures to build and maintain your spiritual stamina and muscle tone. Make
your priesthood fitness a priority, applying the constant dedication of a
professional athlete until it consumes your life, until it flows from you with
nerves and mind conditioned.

And as you too retire at night, your hearts and thoughts and prayers will
automatically turn, once again, with great desire to the perfecting of your
performance on the Lord's great priesthood team. In the name of Jesus Christ,
amen.
