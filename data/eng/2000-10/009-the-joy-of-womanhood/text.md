# The Joy of Womanhood

It is a remarkable blessing to be a daughter of God today. We have the fulness
of the gospel of Jesus Christ. We are blessed to have the priesthood restored
to the earth. We are led by a prophet of God who holds all of the priesthood
keys. I love and honor President Gordon B. Hinckley and all of our brethren
who bear the priesthood worthily.

I am inspired by the lives of good and faithful women. From the beginning of
time the Lord has placed significant trust in them. He has sent us to earth
for such a time as this to perform a grand and glorious mission. The Doctrine
and Covenants teaches, "Even before they were born, they, with many others,
received their first lessons in the world of spirits and were prepared to come
forth in the due time of the Lord to labor in his vineyard for the salvation
of the souls of men" ([D&amp;C 138:56](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-
testament/dc/138.56?lang=eng#55)). What a wonderful vision that gives us of
our purpose on earth.

Where much is given, much is required. Our Heavenly Father asks His daughters
to walk in virtue, to live in righteousness so that we can fulfill our life's
mission and His purposes. He wants us to be successful, and He will help us as
we seek His help.

That women were born into this earth female was determined long before mortal
birth, as were the divine differences of male and female. I love the clarity
of the teachings of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve in the
proclamation on the family, where they state, "Gender is an essential
characteristic of individual premortal, mortal, and eternal identity and
purpose." [1]  From that statement we are taught that every girl was feminine
and female in spirit long before her mortal birth.

God sent women to earth with some qualities in extra capacity. In speaking to
young women, President Faust observed that femininity "is the divine adornment
of humanity. It finds expression in your ... capacity to love, your
spirituality, delicacy, radiance, sensitivity, creativity, charm,
graciousness, gentleness, dignity, and quiet strength. It is manifest
differently in each girl or woman, but each ... possesses it. Femininity is part
of your inner beauty." [2]

Our outward appearance is a reflection of what we are on the inside. Our lives
reflect that for which we seek. And if with all our hearts we truly seek to
know the Savior and to be more like Him, we shall be, for He is our divine,
eternal Brother. But He is more than that. He is our precious Savior, our dear
Redeemer. We ask with Alma of old, "Have ye received his image in your
countenances?" ([Alma
5:14](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.14?lang=eng#13)).

You can recognize women who are grateful to be a daughter of God by their
outward appearance. These women understand their stewardship over their bodies
and treat them with dignity. They care for their bodies as they would a holy
temple, for they understand the Lord's teaching: "Know ye not that ye are the
temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?" ([1 Cor.
3:16](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-cor/3.16?lang=eng#15)). Women who
love God would never abuse or deface a temple with graffiti. Nor would they
throw open the doors of that holy, dedicated edifice and invite the world to
look on. How even more sacred is the body, for it was not made by man. It was
formed by God. We are the stewards, the keepers of the cleanliness and purity
with which it came from heaven. "If any man defile the temple of God, him
shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are" ([1
Cor. 3:17](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-cor/3.17?lang=eng#16)).

Grateful daughters of God guard their bodies carefully, for they know they are
the wellspring of life and they reverence life. They don't uncover their
bodies to find favor with the world. They walk in modesty to be in favor with
their Father in Heaven. For they know He loves them dearly.

You can recognize women who are grateful to be a daughter of God by their
attitude. They know that the errand of angels is given to women, and they
desire to be on God's errand to love His children and minister to them, to
teach them the doctrines of salvation, to call them to repentance, to save
them in perilous circumstances, to guide them in the performance of His work,
to deliver His messages. [3]  They understand that they can bless their
Father's children in their homes and neighborhoods and beyond. Women who are
grateful to be daughters of God bring glory to His name.

You can recognize women who are grateful to be a daughter of God by their
abilities. They fulfill their divine potential and magnify their God-given
gifts. They are capable, strong women who bless families, serve others, and
understand that "the glory of God is intelligence" ([D&amp;C
93:36](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.36?lang=eng#35)).
They are women who embrace enduring virtues in order to be all that our Father
needs them to be. The prophet Jacob spoke of some of those virtues when he
said their "feelings are exceedingly tender and chaste and delicate before
God, which thing is pleasing unto God" ([Jacob
2:7](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/jacob/2.7?lang=eng#6)).

You can recognize women who are grateful to be a daughter of God by their
reverence for motherhood, even when that blessing has been withheld from them
for a time. In those circumstances, their righteous influence can be a
blessing in the lives of children they love. Their exemplary teachings can
echo the voice of a faithful home and resonate truth in the hearts of children
who need another witness.

Grateful daughters of God love Him and teach their children to love Him
without reservation and without resentment. They are like the mothers of
Helaman's youthful army, who had such great faith and "had been taught by
their mothers, that if they did not doubt, God would deliver them" ([Alma
56:47](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/56.47?lang=eng#46)).

When you observe kind and gentle mothers in action, you see women of great
strength. Their families can feel a spirit of love and respect and safety when
they are near her as she seeks the companionship of the Holy Ghost and the
guidance of His Spirit. They are blessed by her wisdom and good judgment. The
husbands and children, whose lives they bless, will contribute to the
stability of societies all over this world. Grateful daughters of God learn
truths from their mothers and grandmothers and aunts. They teach their
daughters the joyful art of creating a home. They seek fine educations for
their children and have a thirst for knowledge themselves. They help their
children develop skills that they can use in serving others. They know that
the way they have chosen is not the easy way, but they know it is absolutely
worth their finest efforts.

They understand what Elder Neal A. Maxwell meant when he said: "When the real
history of mankind is fully disclosed, will it feature the echoes of gunfire
or the shaping sound of lullabies? The great armistices made by military men
or the peacemaking of women in homes and in neighborhoods? Will what happened
in cradles and kitchens prove to be more controlling than what happened in
congresses?" [4]

Daughters of God know that it is the nurturing nature of women that can bring
everlasting blessings, and they live to cultivate this divine attribute.
Surely when a woman reverences motherhood, her children will arise up and call
her blessed (see [Prov.
31:28](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/prov/31.28?lang=eng#27)).

Women of God can never be like women of the world. The world has enough women
who are tough; we need women who are tender. There are enough women who are
coarse; we need women who are kind. There are enough women who are rude; we
need women who are refined. We have enough women of fame and fortune; we need
more women of faith. We have enough greed; we need more goodness. We have
enough vanity; we need more virtue. We have enough popularity; we need more
purity.

Oh, how we pray that every young woman will grow up to be all the wonderful
things she is meant to be. We pray that her mother and father will show her
the right way. May daughters of God honor the priesthood and sustain worthy
priesthood holders. May they understand their own great capacity for strength
in the timeless virtues that some would scoff at in a modern, liberated world
for women.

May mothers and fathers understand the great potential for good their
daughters inherited from their heavenly home. We must nourish their
gentleness, their nurturing nature, their innate spirituality and sensitivity,
and their bright minds. Celebrate the fact that girls are different from boys.
Be thankful for the position they have in God's grand plan. And always
remember what President Hinckley said, "Only after the earth had been formed,
after the day had been separated from the night, after the waters had been
divided from the land, after vegetation and animal life had been created, and
after man had been placed on the earth, was woman created; and only then was
the work pronounced complete and good." [5]

Fathers, husbands, young men, may you catch a vision of all that women are and
can be. Please be worthy of God's holy priesthood, which you bear, and honor
that priesthood, for it blesses all of us.

Sisters, regardless of your age, please understand all that you are and must
be, all that you were prepared to be in royal courts on high by God Himself.
May we use with gratitude the priceless gifts we have been given for the
lifting of mankind to higher thinking and nobler aspirations, I pray in the
name of Jesus Christ, amen.
