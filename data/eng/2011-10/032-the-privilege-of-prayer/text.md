# The Privilege of Prayer

My beloved sisters and brothers, God our Father is not a feeling or an idea or
a force. He is a holy person who, as the scriptures teach, has a face and
hands and a glorious immortal body. He is real, He knows each of us
individually, and He loves us, every one. He wants to bless us.

Jesus said:

"Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a
stone?

"Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?

"If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how
much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that
ask him?" ([Matthew 7:9-11](/scriptures/nt/matt/7.9-11?lang=eng#8)).

Perhaps a personal experience will help to illustrate the point. When I was a
young resident physician at Boston Children's Hospital, I worked long hours
and traveled between the hospital and our home in Watertown, Massachusetts,
mostly by bicycle since my wife and young family needed our car. One evening I
was riding home after a long period in the hospital, feeling tired and hungry
and at least a bit discouraged. I knew I needed to give my wife and four small
children not only my time and energy when I got home but also a cheery
attitude. I was, frankly, finding it hard to just keep pedaling.

My route would take me past a fried chicken shop, and I felt like I would be a
lot less hungry and tired if I could pause for a piece of chicken on my way
home. I knew they were running a sale on thighs or drumsticks for 29 cents
each, but when I checked my wallet, all I had was one nickel. As I rode along,
I told the Lord my situation and asked if, in His mercy, He could let me find
a quarter on the side of the road. I told Him that I didn't need this as a
sign but that I would be really grateful if He felt to grant me this kind
blessing.

I began watching the ground more intently but saw nothing. Trying to maintain
a faith-filled but submissive attitude as I rode, I approached the store.
Then, almost exactly across the street from the chicken place, I saw a quarter
on the ground. With gratitude and relief, I picked it up, bought the chicken,
savored every morsel, and rode happily home.

In His mercy, the God of heaven, the Creator and Ruler of all things
everywhere, had heard a prayer about a very minor thing. One might well ask
why He would concern Himself with something so small. I am led to believe that
our Heavenly Father loves us so much that the things that are important to us
become important to Him, just because He loves us. How much more would He want
to help us with the big things that we ask, which are right (see [3 Nephi
18:20](/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/18.20?lang=eng#19))?

Little children, young people, and adults alike, please believe how very much
your loving Heavenly Father wants to bless _you._ But because He will not
infringe upon our agency, we must ask for His help. This is generally done
through prayer. Prayer is one of the most precious gifts of God to man.

On one occasion Jesus's disciples asked, "Lord, teach us to pray" ([Luke
11:1](/scriptures/nt/luke/11.1?lang=eng#0)). In response, Jesus gave us an
example that might serve as a guide to key principles of prayer (see Russell
M. Nelson, "Lessons from the Lord's Prayers," _Liahona_ and _Ensign,_ May
2009, 46-49; see also [Matthew 6:9-13](/scriptures/nt/matt/6.9-13?lang=eng#8);
[Luke 11:1-4](/scriptures/nt/luke/11.1-4?lang=eng#0)). According to Jesus's
example:

We start by speaking to our Heavenly Father: "Our Father which art in heaven"
([Matthew 6:9](/scriptures/nt/matt/6.9?lang=eng#8); [Luke
11:2](/scriptures/nt/luke/11.2?lang=eng#1)). It is our privilege to approach
our Father directly. We do not pray to any other being. Remember that we have
been counseled to avoid repetitions, including using the name of the Father
too often as we pray.[1]

"Hallowed be thy name" ([Matthew 6:9](/scriptures/nt/matt/6.9?lang=eng#8);
[Luke 11:2](/scriptures/nt/luke/11.2?lang=eng#1)). Jesus addressed His Father
in an attitude of worship, recognizing His greatness and giving Him praise and
thanks. Surely this matter of reverencing God and giving heartfelt and
specific thanks is one of the keys to effective prayer.

"Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done" ([Matthew
6:10](/scriptures/nt/matt/6.10?lang=eng#9); [Luke
11:2](/scriptures/nt/luke/11.2?lang=eng#1)). We freely acknowledge our
dependence on the Lord and express our desire to do His will, even if it is
not the same as our will. Our Bible Dictionary explains: "Prayer is the act by
which the will of the Father and the will of the child are brought into
correspondence with each other. The object of prayer is not to change the will
of God, but to secure for ourselves and for others blessings that God is
already willing to grant, but that are made conditional on our asking for
them" (Bible Dictionary, "Prayer").

"Give us this day our daily bread" ([Matthew
6:11](/scriptures/nt/matt/6.11?lang=eng#10); see also [Luke
11:3](/scriptures/nt/luke/11.3?lang=eng#2)). We ask for those things we want
from the Lord. Honesty is essential in requesting things from God. It would
not be fully honest, for example, to ask the Lord for help on a test in school
if I have not paid attention in class, done the homework assigned, or studied
for the test. Often as I pray, the Spirit nudges me to admit that there is
more I should do to receive the help I am asking from the Lord. Then I must
commit and do my part. It is contrary to the economy of heaven for the Lord to
do for us that which we can do for ourselves.

"And forgive us our debts" ([Matthew
6:12](/scriptures/nt/matt/6.12?lang=eng#11)), or in another version, "Forgive
us our sins" ([Luke 11:4](/scriptures/nt/luke/11.4?lang=eng#3)). An essential
and sometimes forgotten part of personal prayer is repentance. For repentance
to work, it must be specific, profound, and lasting.

"As we forgive our debtors" ([Matthew
6:12](/scriptures/nt/matt/6.12?lang=eng#11); see also [Luke
11:4](/scriptures/nt/luke/11.4?lang=eng#3)). The Savior made a clear
connection between being forgiven of our sins and forgiving others who have
wronged us. Sometimes the wrongs others have done to us are very, very painful
and very hard to either forgive or forget. I am so grateful for the comfort
and healing I have found in the Lord's invitation to let go of our hurts and
turn them over to Him. In Doctrine and Covenants, section 64, He said:

"I, the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive, but of you it is required to
forgive all men.

"And ye ought to say in your hearts--let God judge between me and thee, and
reward thee according to thy deeds" ([verses 10-11](/scriptures/dc-
testament/dc/64.10-11?lang=eng#9)).

Then we must drop the matter completely, letting the Lord take it from there,
if we desire to be healed.

"And suffer us not to be led into temptation, but deliver us from evil"
([Matthew 6:13, footnote a](/scriptures/nt/matt/6.13a?lang=eng); from Joseph
Smith Translation, Matthew 6:14; see also [Luke 11:4, footnote
c](/scriptures/nt/luke/11.4c?lang=eng); from Joseph Smith Translation). Thus,
in our prayers we may begin the protective process of putting on the whole
armor of God (see [Ephesians 6:11](/scriptures/nt/eph/6.11?lang=eng#10);
[D&amp;C 27:15](/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/27.15?lang=eng#14)) by looking
forward to the day ahead and asking for help with the sometimes frightening
things we may face. Please, my friends, do not forget to ask the Lord to
protect and be with you.

"For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever" ([Matthew
6:13](/scriptures/nt/matt/6.13?lang=eng#12)). How instructive it is that Jesus
concluded this prayer by praising God again and expressing His reverence for
and submission to the Father. When we truly believe that God rules His kingdom
and that He has all power and all glory, we are recognizing that He really is
in charge, that He loves us with a perfect love, and that He wants us to be
happy. I have found that one of the secrets to a joyful life is to recognize
that doing things the Lord's way will make me happier than doing things my
way.

There is a risk that a person may not feel good enough to pray. This idea
comes from that evil spirit who is the one who teaches us not to pray (see [2
Nephi 32:8](/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/32.8?lang=eng#7)). It is as tragic to think
we are too sinful to pray as it is for a very sick person to believe he is too
sick to go to the doctor!

We must not imagine that any kind of prayer, no matter how sincere, will be
very effective if all we do is to say the prayer. We must not only say our
prayers; we must also live them. The Lord is much more pleased with the person
who prays and then goes to work than with the person who only prays. Much like
medicine, prayer works only when we use it as directed.

When I say that prayer is a sweet privilege, it is not just because I am
grateful to be able to talk to Heavenly Father and to feel His Spirit when I
pray. It is also because He actually answers and speaks to us. Of course, the
way He speaks to us is usually not with a voice we hear. President Boyd K.
Packer explained: "That sweet, quiet voice of inspiration comes more as a
feeling than it does as a sound. Pure intelligence can be spoken into the
mind. ... This guidance comes as thoughts, as feelings through promptings and
impressions" ("Prayer and Promptings," _Liahona_ and _Ensign,_ Nov. 2009, 44).

Sometimes we seem to get no answer to our sincere and striving prayers. It
takes faith to remember that the Lord answers in His time and in His way so as
to best bless us. Or, on further reflection, we will often realize that we
already know full well what we should do.

Please do not be discouraged if this does not work for you all at once. Like
learning a foreign language, it takes practice and effort. Please know,
though, that you can learn the language of the Spirit, and when you do, it
will give you great faith and power in righteousness.

I cherish the counsel of our beloved prophet, President Thomas S. Monson, who
said: "To those within the sound of my voice who are struggling with
challenges and difficulties large and small, prayer is the provider of
spiritual strength; it is the passport to peace. Prayer is the means by which
we approach our Father in Heaven, who loves us. Speak to Him in prayer and
then listen for the answer. Miracles are wrought through prayer" ("Be Your
Best Self," _Liahona_ and _Ensign,_ May 2009, 68).

I am deeply grateful for the privilege of going to my holy Heavenly Father in
prayer. I am thankful for the countless times He has heard and answered me.
Because He answers me, including sometimes in predictive and miraculous ways,
I know He lives. I also humbly testify that Jesus, His holy Son, is our living
Savior. This is His Church and kingdom on the earth; this work is true. Thomas
S. Monson, for whom we fervently pray, is His prophet. Of which things I
testify with full certainty in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
