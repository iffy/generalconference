# The Songs They Could Not Sing

Many people face significant problems or even tragedy during this mortal
journey. All over the world we see examples of trials and tribulations.[1] We
are moved in our souls by television images of death, acute suffering, and
despair. We see the Japanese struggling heroically against devastation from an
earthquake and tsunami. The haunting scenes from the destruction of the World
Trade Center towers, which we recently reviewed, were painful to relive.
Something stirs us when we become aware of such tragedy, especially when
suffered by innocent people.

Sometimes tragedies are very personal. A son or daughter dies early in life or
falls victim to a devastating disease. A loving parent's life is taken because
of a thoughtless act or accident. Whenever tragedy occurs, we mourn and strive
to bear one another's burdens.[2] We lament the things that will not be
accomplished and the songs that will not be sung.

Among the most frequently asked questions of Church leaders are, Why does a
just God allow bad things to happen, especially to good people? Why are those
who are righteous and in the Lord's service not immune from such tragedies?

While we do not know all the answers, we do know important principles that
allow us to face tragedies with faith and confidence that there is a bright
future planned for each of us. Some of the most important principles are:

First, we have a Father in Heaven, who knows and loves us personally and
understands our suffering perfectly.

Second, His Son, Jesus Christ, is our Savior and Redeemer, whose Atonement not
only provides for salvation and exaltation but also will compensate for all
the unfairness of life.

Third, the Father's plan of happiness for His children includes not only a
premortal and mortal life but also an eternal life as well, including a great
and glorious reunion with those we have lost. All wrongs will be righted, and
we will see with perfect clarity and faultless perspective and understanding.

From the limited perspective of those who do not have knowledge,
understanding, or faith in the Father's plan--who look at the world only
through the lens of mortality with its wars, violence, disease, and evil--this
life can seem depressing, chaotic, unfair, and meaningless. Church leaders
have compared this perspective with someone walking into the middle of a
three-act play.[3] Those without knowledge of the Father's plan do not
understand what happened in the first act, or the premortal existence, and the
purposes established there; nor do they understand the clarification and
resolution that come in the third act, which is the glorious fulfillment of
the Father's plan.

Many do not appreciate that under His loving and comprehensive plan, those who
appear to be disadvantaged through no fault of their own are not ultimately
penalized.[4]

In a few months it will be 100 years since the tragic sinking of the _Titanic_
ocean liner. The calamitous circumstances surrounding this horrendous event
have resonated across the entire century since it occurred. The promoters of
the new luxury liner, which was 11 stories high and almost 3 football fields
long,[5] made excessive and unjustified claims as to the lack of vulnerability
of the _Titanic_ to winter waters full of icebergs. This ship was supposedly
unsinkable; yet when it slipped beneath the surface of the icy Atlantic Ocean,
over 1,500 souls lost their mortal lives.[6]

In many ways the sinking of the _Titanic_ is a metaphor for life and many
gospel principles. It is a perfect example of the difficulty of looking only
through the lens of this mortal life. The loss of life was catastrophic in its
consequences but was of an accidental nature. With the carnage of two world
wars and having just passed the 10th anniversary of the destruction of the
World Trade Center towers, we have seen in our own time a window into the
shock, agony, and moral issues surrounding events resulting from the evil
exercise of agency. There are terrible repercussions to family, friends, and
nations as a result of these tragedies, regardless of the cause.

With respect to the _Titanic,_ lessons were learned about the dangers of pride
and traveling in troubled waters and "that God is no respecter of persons."[7]
Those involved were from all walks of life. Some were rich and famous, such as
John Jacob Astor; but there were also laborers, immigrants, women, children,
and crew members.[8]

There were at least two Latter-day Saint connections to the _Titanic._ Both
illustrate our challenge in understanding trials, tribulations, and tragedies
and provide insight as to how we might deal with them. The first is an example
of being appreciative for the blessings we receive and the challenges we
avoid. It involves Alma Sonne, who later served as a General Authority.[9] He
was my stake president when I was born in Logan, Utah. I had my mission
interview with Elder Sonne. In those days all prospective missionaries were
interviewed by a General Authority. He was a great influence in my life.

When Alma was a young man, he had a friend named Fred who was less active in
the Church. They had numerous discussions about serving a mission, and
eventually Alma Sonne convinced Fred to prepare and serve. They were both
called to the British Mission. At the conclusion of their missions, Elder
Sonne, the mission secretary, made the travel arrangements for their return to
the United States. He booked passage on the _Titanic_ for himself, Fred, and
four other missionaries who had also completed their missions.[10]

When it came time to travel, for some reason Fred was delayed. Elder Sonne
canceled all six bookings to sail on the new luxury liner on its maiden voyage
and booked passage on a ship that sailed the next day.[11] The four
missionaries, who were excited about traveling on the _Titanic,_ expressed
their disappointment. Elder Sonne's answer paraphrased the account of Joseph
and his brothers in Egypt recorded in Genesis: "How can we return to our
families and the lad be not with us?"[12] He explained to his companions that
they all came to England together and they all should return home together.
Elder Sonne subsequently learned of the _Titanic_'s sinking and gratefully
said to his friend Fred, "You saved my life." Fred replied, "No, by getting me
on this mission, you saved my life."[13] All of the missionaries thanked the
Lord for preserving them.[14]

Sometimes, as was the case with Elder Sonne and his missionary associates,
great blessings come to those who are faithful. We should be grateful for all
the tender mercies that come into our lives.[15] We are unaware of hosts of
blessings that we receive from day to day. It is extremely important that we
have a spirit of gratitude in our hearts.[16]

The scriptures are clear: those who are righteous, follow the Savior, and keep
His commandments will prosper in the land.[17] An essential element of
prospering is having the Spirit in our lives.

However, righteousness, prayer, and faithfulness will not always result in
happy endings in mortality. Many will experience severe trials. When this
happens, the very act of having faith and seeking priesthood blessings is
approved by God. The Lord has declared, "The elders ... shall be called, and
shall pray for and lay their hands upon them in my name; and if they die they
shall die unto me, and if they live they shall live unto me."[18]

It is instructive that the second Latter-day Saint connection with the
_Titanic_ did not have a happy mortal ending. Irene Corbett was 30 years old.
She was a young wife and mother from Provo, Utah. She had significant talents
as an artist and musician; she was also a teacher and a nurse. At the urging
of medical professionals in Provo, she attended a six-month course of study on
midwife skills in London. It was her great desire to make a difference in the
world. She was careful, thoughtful, prayerful, and valiant. One of the reasons
she chose the _Titanic_ to return to the United States was because she thought
the missionaries would be traveling with her and that this would provide
additional safety. Irene was one of the few women who did not survive this
terrible tragedy. Most of the women and children were placed in the lifeboats
and were ultimately rescued. There were not enough lifeboats for everyone. But
it is believed that she did not get in the lifeboats because, with her special
training, she was attending to the needs of the numerous passengers who were
injured from the iceberg collision.[19]

There are many kinds of challenges. Some give us necessary experiences.
Adverse results in this mortal life are not evidence of lack of faith or of an
imperfection in our Father in Heaven's overall plan. The refiner's fire is
real, and qualities of character and righteousness that are forged in the
furnace of affliction perfect and purify us and prepare us to meet God.

When the Prophet Joseph Smith was a prisoner in Liberty Jail, the Lord
declared to him that multiple calamities can befall mankind. The Savior stated
in part, "If thou be cast into the deep; if the billowing surge conspire
against thee; if fierce winds become thine enemy; ... and all the elements
combine to hedge up the way; ... these things shall give thee experience, and
shall be for thy good."[20] The Savior concluded His instruction: "Thy days
are known, and thy years shall not be numbered less; therefore, fear not ... ,
for God shall be with you forever and ever."[21]

Some challenges result from the agency of others. Agency is essential for
individual spiritual growth and development. Evil conduct is an element of
agency. Captain Moroni explained this very important doctrine: "The Lord
suffereth the righteous to be slain that his justice and judgment may come
upon the wicked." He made it clear that the righteous are not lost but "enter
into the rest of the Lord their God."[22] The wicked will be held accountable
for the atrocities they perpetrate.[23]

Some challenges come from disobedience to God's laws. Health problems
resulting from smoking, alcohol, and drug abuse are staggering. Incarceration
in jails and prisons as a result of alcohol- and drug-related crime is also
very high.[24]

The incidence of divorce because of infidelity is also significant. Many of
these trials and tribulations could be avoided by obedience to God's laws.[25]

My beloved mission president, Elder Marion D. Hanks (who passed away in
August), asked us as missionaries to memorize a statement to resist mortal
challenges: "There is no chance, no fate, no destiny that can circumvent or
hinder or control the firm resolve of a determined soul."[26]

He acknowledged that this doesn't apply to all the challenges we encounter but
is true in spiritual matters. I have appreciated his counsel in my life.

One of the reasons for the terrible loss of life on the _Titanic_ is that
there were not enough lifeboats. Regardless of the trials we face in this
life, the Savior's Atonement provides lifeboats for everyone. For those who
think the trials they face are unfair, the Atonement covers all of the
unfairness of life.[27]

A unique challenge for those who have lost loved ones is to avoid dwelling on
the lost opportunities in this life. Often those who die early have
demonstrated significant capabilities, interests, and talents. With our
limited understanding, we lament the things that will not be accomplished and
the songs that will not be sung. This has been described as dying with your
music still inside you. Music in this case is a metaphor for unfulfilled
potential of any kind. Sometimes people have made significant preparation but
do not have the opportunity to perform in mortality.[28] One of the most
quoted classical poems, "Elegy Written in a Country Church Yard," by Thomas
Gray, reflects on such missed opportunities:

_Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,_

_And waste its sweetness on the desert air._ [29]

The lost opportunity might relate to family, occupation, talents, experiences,
or others. All of these were cut short in the case of Sister Corbett. There
were songs she did not sing and potential she did not fulfill in this mortal
life. But when we look through the wide and clear lens of the gospel instead
of the limited lens of mere mortal existence, we know of the great eternal
reward promised by a loving Father in His plan. As the Apostle Paul taught,
"Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man,
the things which God hath prepared for them that love him."[30] A line from a
beloved hymn provides comfort, solace, and the clear lens: "And Jesus
listening can hear the songs I cannot sing."[31]

The Savior said: "Therefore, let your hearts be comforted. ... Be still and know
that I am God."[32] We have His promise that we with our children will sing
"songs of everlasting joy."[33] In the name of Jesus Christ, our Savior, amen.
