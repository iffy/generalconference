# Teaching after the Manner of the Spirit

Many years ago I was with my companion at the missionary training center when
I heard the voice of a child say, "Grandma, are those _real_ missionaries?" I
turned to see a young girl holding her grandmother's hand and pointing at me
and my companion. I smiled, extended my hand, looked her square in the eye,
and said, "Hello, I am Elder Richardson, and we are _real_ missionaries." Her
face beamed as she looked at me, thrilled that she was in the company of
genuine missionaries.

I walked away from that experience with renewed dedication. I wanted to be the
type of missionary that the Savior, my family, and this young girl expected me
to be. For the next two years, I worked hard to look like, think like, act
like, and especially to teach like a _real_ missionary.

Upon my return home, it became increasingly apparent that even though I had
left my mission, my mission didn't leave me. In fact, even after all these
years, I still feel that my mission was the best two years _for_ my life. One
unexpected carryover from my mission was that young girl's voice. Only now I
was hearing in my mind, "Grandma, is that a _real_ priesthood holder?"
"Grandma, is that a _real_ husband or a _real_ father?" or "Grandma, is that a
_real_ member of the Church?"

I have learned that a key to becoming _real_ in every aspect of our lives is
our ability to teach in a way that does not restrict learning. You see, a
_real life_ requires _real learning,_ which depends on _real teaching._ "The
responsibility to teach [effectively] is not limited to those who have formal
callings as teachers."[1] In fact, every family member, Church leader, and
Church member (including the youth and children) has a responsibility to
teach.

While we are all teachers, we must fully realize that it is the Holy Ghost who
is the _real_ teacher and witness of all truth. Those who do not fully
understand this either try to take over for the Holy Ghost and do everything
themselves, politely invite the Spirit to be with them but only in a
supporting role, or believe they are turning all their teaching over to the
Spirit when, in truth, they are actually just "winging it." All parents,
leaders, and teachers have the responsibility to teach "by the Spirit."[2]
They should not teach "in front of the Spirit" or "behind the Spirit" but "by
the Spirit" so the Spirit can teach the truth unrestrained.

Moroni helps us understand how we can teach by the Spirit without replacing,
diluting, or dismissing the Holy Ghost as the _real_ teacher. Moroni said the
Saints conducted their experiences "after the manner of the workings of the
Spirit."[3] This requires more than just having the Spirit with us. To conduct
ourselves "after the manner" of the Holy Ghost means that we may need to
change our way of teaching to emulate the way the Holy Ghost teaches. As we
align our manner with the Holy Ghost's manner, then the Holy Ghost can teach
and testify without restraint. This important alignment may be illustrated by
the following example.

Many years ago my children and I hiked to the top of South Sister, a
10,358-foot (3,157 m) mountain in Oregon. After several hours we encountered a
long 45-degree slope of tiny volcanic pebbles. With the summit in sight, we
pressed on only to find that with every step, our feet would sink in the
pebbles, causing us to slide backward several inches. My 12-year-old son
forged ahead as I stayed with my 8-year-old daughter. Fatigue and
discouragement soon set in, and she was heartbroken, thinking that she might
not join her brother at the top. My first impulse was to carry her. My spirit
was willing, but sadly my flesh was weak. We sat down on the rocks, assessed
our situation, and devised a new plan. I told her to put her hands in my back
pants pockets, hold on tight, and--most important--as soon as I lifted my foot
to take a step, she should quickly put her foot in its place. She mirrored my
every move and relied on the lift that came from hanging on to my pockets.
After what seemed like an eternity, we made it to the top of the mountain. Her
expression of triumph and satisfaction was priceless. And yes, she and her
brother were, in my estimation, _real_ hikers.

My daughter's success was a result of her diligent effort and how well she
hiked _after the manner_ that I hiked. As she synchronized her movement with
mine, we achieved a rhythm together, allowing me to utilize my full energy.
Such is the case when we teach "after the manner of the workings of the
Spirit." As we align the manner of our teaching to match that of the Holy
Ghost, the Spirit strengthens us and, at the same time, is not constrained.
With this in mind, please consider two fundamental "workings of the Spirit"
worthy of our emulation.

First, the Holy Ghost teaches individuals in a very personal way. This makes
it possible for us to intimately know truth for ourselves. Because of our
different needs, circumstances, and progression, the Holy Ghost teaches what
we must know and do so we may become what we must be. Please note that while
the Holy Ghost teaches "the truth of all things,"[4] He does not teach all
truth all at once. The Spirit teaches truth "line upon line, precept upon
precept, here a little and there a little."[5]

Those who teach after the manner of the Spirit understand they teach people,
not lessons. As such, they overcome the urge to cover everything in a manual
or teach all they have learned on the subject and focus instead on those
things that their family or class members need to know and do. Parents,
leaders, and teachers who mirror how the Spirit teaches learn quickly that
_real_ teaching involves much more than just talking and telling. As a result,
they intentionally pause to listen, carefully observe, and then discern what
to do next.[6] When they do this, the Holy Ghost is in a position to teach
both learners and teachers what they should do and say.[7]

Second, the Holy Ghost teaches by inviting, prompting, encouraging, and
inspiring us to act. Christ assured us that we come to the truth when we live
doctrine and act accordingly.[8] The Spirit leads, guides, and shows us what
to do.[9] He will not, however, do for us what only we can do for ourselves.
You see, the Holy Ghost cannot learn _for_ us, feel _for_ us, or act _for_ us
because this would be contrary to the doctrine of agency. He can facilitate
opportunities and invite us to learn, feel, and act.

Those who teach after this manner of the Spirit help others by inviting,
encouraging, and providing them opportunities to use their agency. Parents,
leaders, and teachers realize they cannot feel _for,_ learn _for,_ or even
repent _for_ their family, congregation, or class members. Rather than asking,
"What can I do for my children, class members, or others?" they ask, "How do I
invite and help those around me to learn for themselves?" Parents who mirror
the workings of the Holy Ghost create homes where families learn to value
rather than just learn about values. In like manner, rather than just talking
about doctrines, teachers help learners understand and live gospel doctrines.
The Holy Ghost is unrestrained as individuals exercise _their_ agency
appropriately.

With the current conditions of the world, we desperately need _real_ learning
and teaching in our homes, meetings, and gospel classes. I know that your
quest to improve may seem overwhelming at times. Please do not become
discouraged with your progress. I think back on my experience hiking with my
children. We agreed that every time we stopped to catch our breath, rather
than focusing exclusively on how much farther we needed to go, we would
immediately turn around and look down the mountain. We would take in the
scenery and say to each other, "Look how far we've come." Then we would take a
deep breath, quickly turn, face uphill, and start climbing again one step at a
time. Brothers and sisters, you _can_ parent, lead, and teach after the manner
of the workings of the Spirit. I know you can do this. I testify you can do
this, and lives will change.

My life has been blessed by _real teachers,_ who have taught with the Spirit
and especially by the Spirit. I invite you to align the manner of your
teaching after the manner of the Holy Ghost in all you do. I testify that
Jesus Christ is our Savior and that His gospel is restored. Because of this we
must be _real_ parents, _real_ leaders, _real_ teachers, and _real_ learners.
I testify God will help you in your efforts, in the sacred name of our Savior,
Jesus Christ, amen.
